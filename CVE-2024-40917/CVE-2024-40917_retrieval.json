This in turn led to memblock_alloc_range_nid()s warning about MAX_NUMNODES triggering, followed by a NULL deref in memmap_init() when trying to access node 64s (NODE_SHIFT=6) node data. To compensate said change, make memblock_set_node() warn on and adjust a passed in value of MAX_NUMNODES, just like various other functions already do.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff] was seen', 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'NULL dereference', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'memblock_set_node()'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) configurations on x86 systems with SRAT (System Resource Affinity Table) configurations. Specifically, a recent change (commit ff6c3d81f2e8) optimized NUMA memory detection. This change caused the `memblock_validate_numa_coverage()` to only check for `NUMA_NO_NODE`. In cases where SRAT only covers memory above 4GB, the previous mechanism to refuse this configuration no longer happens, resulting in `memblock_alloc_range_nid()` warning about `MAX_NUMNODES`. Subsequently, this leads to a NULL pointer dereference in `memmap_init()` when it attempts to access node data for the node that has id `MAX_NUMNODES`, which is beyond the valid node ids.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n-   **Incorrect NUMA node assignment:** The kernel incorrectly interprets the NUMA configuration when SRAT only describes memory regions above 4GB. It proceeds with a configuration using a node ID equal to `MAX_NUMNODES` which is not valid.\\n-   **Lack of proper bounds checking:** There is insufficient validation in `memblock_set_node` when a node id equals `MAX_NUMNODES` is used.\\n-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference when `memmap_init()` tries to access the memory map for the invalid node.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n-   **Kernel crash:** The NULL pointer dereference in `memmap_init()` results in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n-   **System configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific system configuration: an older x86 system with an SRAT that only covers memory above 4GB.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n-   **No direct attacker action is needed**. The vulnerability is triggered by the system's configuration, and arises during the kernel's initialization process.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The provided patches address the vulnerability by making `memblock_set_node()` issue a warning and adjust the passed-in `MAX_NUMNODES` value to `NUMA_NO_NODE`, thus preventing the use of the invalid node id.\\n- The fix aims to prevent the crash and maintain compatibility with the optimized NUMA memory detection logic.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '201', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(608.6075929589678)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '401', 'name': 'Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(602.9117372267854)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '214', 'name': 'Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(601.5648601355913)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '863', 'name': 'Incorrect Authorization', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(584.551579141565)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '400', 'name': 'Uncontrolled Resource Consumption', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(570.6483101434306)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1260', 'name': 'Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': 'The product allows address regions to overlap, which can result in the bypassing of intended memory protection.', 'keyphrase_source': 'rootcause:faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff] was seen', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta5, a user's read state for a topic such as the last read post number and the notification level is exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-38999: IBM MQ Appliance could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information by inclusion of sensitive data within trace.\n\n- CVE-2021-20498: IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 reveals version information in HTTP requests that could be used in further attacks against the system.

IBM X-Force ID: 199398.\n\n- CVE-2021-28544: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 212038\n\n- CVE-2021-39013: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.7.2.0, 1.7.1.0, and 1.7.0.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in HTTP responses that could be used in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 213651.\n\n- CVE-2021-41767: Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses. This may allow an authenticated user who already has permission to access a particular connection to read from or interact with another user's active use of that same connection.\n\n- CVE-2021-45603: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by disclosure of sensitive information.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users.

In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch.

The continuous flapping of an IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE restart to restore service. The following error messages will be seen after the FPC resources have been exhausted: fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 This issue only affects the ACX5448 router.

It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-23471: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c. This issue was caused by the incorrect use of libxml2 API. The vendor forgot to call 'g_free()' to release the return value of 'xmlGetProp()'.\n\n- CVE-2021-42523: There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec' is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.\n\n- CVE-2022-26365: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2021-3690: A flaw was found in Undertow. A buffer leak on the incoming WebSocket PONG message may lead to memory exhaustion. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, and 3.6.5. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-24307: Mastodon before 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6 has incorrect access control because it does not compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. (JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.)\n\n- CVE-2022-24714: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message: \"DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET: Warning: Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNH:aggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc <fpc number> for <n> times, started at <timestamp>\" This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-22119: Spring Security versions 5.5.x prior to 5.5.1, 5.4.x prior to 5.4.7, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.10 and 5.2.x prior to 5.2.11 are susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via the initiation of the Authorization Request in an OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application. A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform. An attacker can use this flaw to trick a user, with privileges to pull container images, into crashing the process responsible for pulling the image. This flaw affects containers-image versions before 5.2.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-1750: A flaw was found in the machine-config-operator that causes an OpenShift node to become unresponsive when a container consumes a large amount of memory. An attacker could use this flaw to deny access to schedule new pods in the OpenShift cluster. This was fixed in openshift/machine-config-operator 4.4.3, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.3.25, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.2.36.\n\n- CVE-2020-20217: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/route process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/cerm process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20230: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the sshd process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20248: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the memtest process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-25242: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Advanced (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Lean (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Standard (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions). Specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 102 could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on the affected devices. A cold restart might be necessary in order to recover.\n\n- CVE-2020-28944: OX Guard 2.10.4 and earlier allows a Denial of Service via a WKS server that responds slowly or with a large amount of data.\n\n- CVE-2020-35498: A vulnerability was found in openvswitch. A limitation in the implementation of userspace packet parsing can allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted packet causing the resulting megaflow in the kernel to be too wide, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-35510: A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001. A malicious attacker could cause threads to hold up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the EJB client code resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-36332: A flaw was found in libwebp in versions before 1.0.1. When reading a file libwebp allocates an excessive amount of memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to the service availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-8299: Citrix ADC and Citrix/NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-76.29, 12.1-61.18, 11.1-65.20, Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.238, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP Edition before 11.4.0, 11.3.2, 11.3.1a, 11.2.3a, 11.1.2c, 10.2.9a suffers from uncontrolled resource consumption by way of a network-based denial-of-service from within the same Layer 2 network segment. Note that the attacker must be in the same Layer 2 network segment as the vulnerable appliance.\n\n- CVE-2020-9000: An issue was discovered in iPortalis iCS 7.1.13.0. Attackers can send a sequence of requests to rapidly cause .NET Input Validation errors. This increases the size of the log file on the remote server until memory is exhausted, therefore consuming the maximum amount of resources (triggering a denial of service condition).\n\n- CVE-2021-0008: Uncontrolled resource consumption in firmware for Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters 800 Series Controllers and associated adapters before version 1.5.3.0 may allow privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0180: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel(R) HAXM software before version 7.6.6 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable privilege escalation via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0182: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel(R) HAXM software before version 7.6.6 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0229: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause MQTT server to crash and restart leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a stream of specific packets. A Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) application designed with a listening port uses the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect to a mosquitto broker that is running on Junos OS to subscribe for events. Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1R1 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S4; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S1, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S2, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.

Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.\n\n- CVE-2021-39171: Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication library. Prior to version 3.1.0, a malicious SAML payload can require transforms that consume significant system resources to process, thereby resulting in reduced or denied service. This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack. This has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.\n\n- CVE-2021-21369: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-21529: Dell System Update (DSU) 1.9 and earlier versions contain a denial of service vulnerability.

Existing connections are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31006: indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.\n\n- CVE-2022-31030: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device.

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-25458: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ION driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25462: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in NPU driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25491: A vulnerability in mfc driver prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows memory corruption via NULL-pointer dereference.\n\n- CVE-2021-32282: An issue was discovered in gravity through 0.8.1. A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function ircode_add_check() located in gravity_ircode.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37639: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3119: Zetetic SQLCipher 4.x before 4.4.3 has a NULL pointer dereferencing issue related to sqlcipher_export in crypto.c and sqlite3StrICmp in sqlite3.c.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus. Flask-RESTX before version 0.5.1 is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in email_regex.

Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.\n\n- CVE-2022-31147: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms. Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306. Users should upgrade to version 1.19.5 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31781: Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types. Specially crafted Content Types may cause catastrophic backtracking, taking exponential time to complete. Specifically, this is about the regular expression used on the parameter of the org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered by web requests in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry codepath passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor.\n\n- CVE-2022-34402: Dell Wyse ThinOS 2205 contains a Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability in UI.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

CVE-2022-23042\n\n- CVE-2022-23041: Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.

The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

These ranges are usually defined using special range registers that contain information, such as base address and size. Address decoding is the process of determining for which range the incoming transaction is destined. To ensure isolation, ranges containing secret data are access-control protected.\n\n\nOccasionally, these ranges could overlap. The overlap could either be intentional (e.g. due to a limited number of range registers or limited choice in choosing size of the range) or unintentional (e.g. introduced by errors). Some hardware designs allow dynamic remapping of address ranges assigned to peripheral MMIO ranges. In such designs, intentional address overlaps can be created through misconfiguration by malicious software. When protected and unprotected ranges overlap, an attacker could send a transaction and potentially compromise the protections in place, violating the principle of least privilege. \n",

These ranges are usually defined using special range registers that contain information, such as base address and size. Address decoding is the process of determining for which range the incoming transaction is destined. To ensure isolation, ranges containing secret data are access-control protected.\n\n\nOccasionally, these ranges could overlap. The overlap could either be intentional (e.g. due to a limited number of range registers or limited choice in choosing size of the range) or unintentional (e.g. introduced by errors). Some hardware designs allow dynamic remapping of address ranges assigned to peripheral MMIO ranges. In such designs, intentional address overlaps can be created through misconfiguration by malicious software. When protected and unprotected ranges overlap, an attacker could send a transaction and potentially compromise the protections in place, violating the principle of least privilege. \n",

The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.\n\n- CVE-2021-33687: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\n- CVE-2021-3509: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4. Accessing the endpoint /api/version leaks internal information for the system, and this endpoint is not protected with authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-30156: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Special:Contributions can leak that a \"hidden\" user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-32731: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40862: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise up to v202108-1 contained an API endpoint that erroneously disclosed a sensitive URL to authenticated parties, which could be used for privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of a Terraform configuration. Fixed in v202109-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-41140: Discourse-reactions is a plugin for the Discourse platform that allows user to add their reactions to the post. In affected versions reactions given by user to secure topics and private messages are visible. This issue is patched in version 0.2 of discourse-reaction. Users who are unable to update are advised to disable the Discourse-reactions plugin in admin panel.\n\n- CVE-2021-37326: NetSarang Xshell 7 before Build 0077 includes unintended code strings in paste operations.\n\n- CVE-2020-13597: Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

This vulnerability is due to improper resource management when connection rates are high. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-28665: Stormshield SNS with versions before 3.7.18, 3.11.6 and 4.1.6 has a memory-management defect in the SNMP plugin that can lead to excessive consumption of memory and CPU resources, and possibly a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3181: rfc822.c in Mutt through 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mailbox unavailability) by sending email messages with sequences of semicolon characters in RFC822 address fields (aka terminators of empty groups). A small email message from the attacker can cause large memory consumption, and the victim may then be unable to see email messages from other persons.\n\n- CVE-2021-41145: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-31261: The gf_hinter_track_new function in GPAC 1.0.1 allows attackers to read memory via a crafted file in the MP4Box command.\n\n- CVE-2020-22844: A buffer overflow in Mikrotik RouterOS 6.47 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via crafted SMB requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-40008: There is a memory leak vulnerability in CloudEngine 12800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 5800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 6800 V200R019C00SPC800 and CloudEngine 7800 V200R019C00SPC800. The software does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory while parse a series of crafted binary messages, which could consume remaining memory. Successful exploit could cause memory exhaust.\n\n- CVE-2022-20046: In Bluetooth, there is a possible memory corruption due to a logic error. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06142410; Issue ID: ALPS06142410.\n\n- CVE-2021-33437: An issue was discovered in mjs (mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine), ES6 (JavaScript version 6).

It allows an attacker to cause code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0854: A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n\n- CVE-2022-22155: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the handling of IPv6 neighbor state change events in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) of an ACX5448 router. The continuous flapping of an IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE restart to restore service. The following error messages will be seen after the FPC resources have been exhausted: fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 This issue only affects the ACX5448 router.

It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-38178: By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed EdDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-23471: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c. This issue was caused by the incorrect use of libxml2 API. The vendor forgot to call 'g_free()' to release the return value of 'xmlGetProp()'.\n\n- CVE-2021-42523: There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec' is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.\n\n- CVE-2022-26365: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2021-3690: A flaw was found in Undertow. A buffer leak on the incoming WebSocket PONG message may lead to memory exhaustion. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38371: A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE MBC (PPC) (BACnet) (All versions), APOGEE MBC (PPC) (P2 Ethernet) (All versions), APOGEE MEC (PPC) (BACnet) (All versions), APOGEE MEC (PPC) (P2 Ethernet) (All versions), APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.21), APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.21), Desigo PXC00-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC00-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC001-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC100-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC12-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC128-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC200-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC22-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC22.1-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC36.1-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC50-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC64-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXM20-E (All versions >= V2.3), Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V1 (All versions < V5.2a), Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V2 (All versions < V5.4), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2012 (All versions < V2012.08.1), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2017 (All versions < V2017.02.4), Nucleus Source Code (All versions including affected FTP server), TALON TC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), TALON TC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7). The FTP server does not properly release memory resources that were reserved for incomplete connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial of service condition on devices that incorporate a vulnerable version of the FTP server.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-772 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-404 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-404 (ChildOf)",

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1.

SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0).

For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).\n\n- CVE-2020-36289: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the QueryComponentRendererValue!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1. In some cases, there is improper enforcement of the privilege requirement for viewing a list of tickets that shows title, state, etc.\n\n- CVE-2021-22134: A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon.

Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message: \"DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET: Warning: Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNH:aggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc <fpc number> for <n> times, started at <timestamp>\" This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-22119: Spring Security versions 5.5.x prior to 5.5.1, 5.4.x prior to 5.4.7, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.10 and 5.2.x prior to 5.2.11 are susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via the initiation of the Authorization Request in an OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application. A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform. An attacker can use this flaw to trick a user, with privileges to pull container images, into crashing the process responsible for pulling the image. This flaw affects containers-image versions before 5.2.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-1750: A flaw was found in the machine-config-operator that causes an OpenShift node to become unresponsive when a container consumes a large amount of memory. An attacker could use this flaw to deny access to schedule new pods in the OpenShift cluster. This was fixed in openshift/machine-config-operator 4.4.3, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.3.25, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.2.36.\n\n- CVE-2020-20217: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/route process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/cerm process.

The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.\n\n- CVE-2021-21369: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-21529: Dell System Update (DSU) 1.9 and earlier versions contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run out of memory by running multiple instances of the vulnerable application.\n\n- CVE-2021-21728: A ZTE product has a configuration error vulnerability.

In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy.

Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Improper data handling on branch creation could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-3818: An uncontrolled resource consumption issue when parsing URLs in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows an attacker to cause performance issues and potentially a denial of service on the GitLab instance.\n\n- CVE-2022-39278: Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a large number of NETCONF over SSH connections.

This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-25458: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ION driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25462: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in NPU driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25491: A vulnerability in mfc driver prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows memory corruption via NULL-pointer dereference.\n\n- CVE-2021-32282: An issue was discovered in gravity through 0.8.1. A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function ircode_add_check() located in gravity_ircode.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37639: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3119: Zetetic SQLCipher 4.x before 4.4.3 has a NULL pointer dereferencing issue related to sqlcipher_export in crypto.c and sqlite3StrICmp in sqlite3.c.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus. Flask-RESTX before version 0.5.1 is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in email_regex. This is fixed in version 0.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-32839: sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In sqlparse versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of Service in sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause exponential backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of '\\\\r\\\\n' in SQL comments. Only the formatting feature that removes comments from SQL statements is affected by this regular expression. As a workaround don't use the sqlformat.format function with keyword strip_comments=True or the --strip-comments command line flag when using the sqlformat command line tool. The issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33503: An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5. When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.\n\n- CVE-2021-33580: User controlled `request.getHeader(\"Referer\")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33623: The trim-newlines package before 3.0.1 and 4.x before 4.0.1 for Node.js has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for the .end() method.\n\n- CVE-2021-36716: A ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) flaw was found in the Segment is-email package before 1.0.1 for Node.js.

This has been resolved in version 3.3.6. If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\n\n- CVE-2021-42836: GJSON before 1.9.3 allows a ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-44686: calibre before 5.32.0 contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in html_preprocess_rules in ebooks/conversion/preprocess.py.\n\n- CVE-2020-1920: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the validateBaseUrl function can cause the application to use excessive resources, become unresponsive, or crash.

The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21267: Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS objects (npm package schema-inspector). In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-21306: Marked is an open-source markdown parser and compiler (npm package \"marked\").

The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n- CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38244: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exits in cbioportal 3.6.21 and older via a POST request to /ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json.\n\n- CVE-2021-39917: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.9 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. A regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking that could cause a DOS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-43854: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.\n\n- CVE-2022-31147: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms. Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306. Users should upgrade to version 1.19.5 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31781: Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types. Specially crafted Content Types may cause catastrophic backtracking, taking exponential time to complete. Specifically, this is about the regular expression used on the parameter of the org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered by web requests in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry codepath passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor.\n\n- CVE-2022-34402: Dell Wyse ThinOS 2205 contains a Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability in UI.

An Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.\n\n- CVE-2022-44570: A denial of service vulnerability in the Range header parsing component of Rack >= 1.5.0.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

Not used. No NUMA configuration found Faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff] was seen in the log directly after the message quoted above), because of memblock_validate_numa_coverage() checking for NUMA_NO_NODE (only). This in turn led to memblock_alloc_range_nid()s warning about MAX_NUMNODES triggering, followed by a NULL deref in memmap_init() when trying to access node 64s (NODE_SHIFT=6) node data. To compensate said change, make memblock_set_node() warn on and adjust a passed in value of MAX_NUMNODES, just like various other functions already do.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff] was seen**\n- **impact:** NULL dereference\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **component:** memblock_set_node()\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) configurations on x86 systems with SRAT (System Resource Affinity Table) configurations. Specifically, a recent change (commit ff6c3d81f2e8) optimized NUMA memory detection. This change caused the `memblock_validate_numa_coverage()` to only check for `NUMA_NO_NODE`. In cases where SRAT only covers memory above 4GB, the previous mechanism to refuse this configuration no longer happens, resulting in `memblock_alloc_range_nid()` warning about `MAX_NUMNODES`. Subsequently, this leads to a NULL pointer dereference in `memmap_init()` when it attempts to access node data for the node that has id `MAX_NUMNODES`, which is beyond the valid node ids.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n-   **Incorrect NUMA node assignment:** The kernel incorrectly interprets the NUMA configuration when SRAT only describes memory regions above 4GB. It proceeds with a configuration using a node ID equal to `MAX_NUMNODES` which is not valid.\n-   **Lack of proper bounds checking:** There is insufficient validation in `memblock_set_node` when a node id equals `MAX_NUMNODES` is used.\n-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference when `memmap_init()` tries to access the memory map for the invalid node.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Kernel crash:** The NULL pointer dereference in `memmap_init()` results in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **System configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific system configuration: an older x86 system with an SRAT that only covers memory above 4GB.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **No direct attacker action is needed**. The vulnerability is triggered by the system's configuration, and arises during the kernel's initialization process.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided patches address the vulnerability by making `memblock_set_node()` issue a warning and adjust the passed-in `MAX_NUMNODES` value to `NUMA_NO_NODE`, thus preventing the use of the invalid node id.\n- The fix aims to prevent the crash and maintain compatibility with the optimized NUMA memory detection logic.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.609 |\n| 2 | 401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.603 |\n| 3 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.602 |\n| 4 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.585 |\n| 5 | 400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.571 |\n| 6 | 1260 | Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.492 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.565 |\n| 9 | 476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.560 |\n| 10 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.560 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-497\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLimited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nResource Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \"Resource consumption\" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n**[Other]** \n\nDatabase queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.\n\n\nA prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to \"macof\" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1260: Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product allows address regions to overlap, which can result in the bypassing of intended memory protection.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIsolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies are used by hardware to protect privileged software. Software components are often allowed to change or remap memory region definitions in order to enable flexible and dynamically changeable memory management by system software.\n\n\nIf a software component running at lower privilege can program a memory address region to overlap with other memory regions used by software running at higher privilege, privilege escalation may be available to attackers. The memory protection unit (MPU) logic can incorrectly handle such an address overlap and allow the lower-privilege software to read or write into the protected memory region, resulting in privilege escalation attack. An address overlap weakness can also be used to launch a denial of service attack on the higher-privilege software memory regions.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.6, CWE-1260 and CWE-1316 are siblings under view 1000, but CWE-1260 might be a parent of CWE-1316. More analysis is warranted.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-7096:** virtualization product allows compromise of hardware product by accessing certain remapping registers.\n- **[REF-1100]:** processor design flaw allows ring 0 code to access more privileged rings by causing a register window to overlap a range of protected system RAM [REF-1100]\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nnull deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nNPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception\nnil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-710\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.\n\n- CVE-2021-33687: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\n- CVE-2021-3509: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4. Accessing the endpoint /api/version leaks internal information for the system, and this endpoint is not protected with authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-30156: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Special:Contributions can leak that a \"hidden\" user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-32731: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40862: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise up to v202108-1 contained an API endpoint that erroneously disclosed a sensitive URL to authenticated parties, which could be used for privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of a Terraform configuration. Fixed in v202109-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-41140: Discourse-reactions is a plugin for the Discourse platform that allows user to add their reactions to the post.

Users who are unable to update are advised to disable the Discourse-reactions plugin in admin panel.\n\n- CVE-2021-37326: NetSarang Xshell 7 before Build 0077 includes unintended code strings in paste operations.\n\n- CVE-2020-13597: Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta5, a user's read state for a topic such as the last read post number and the notification level is exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-38999: IBM MQ Appliance could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information by inclusion of sensitive data within trace.\n\n- CVE-2021-20498: IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 reveals version information in HTTP requests that could be used in further attacks against the system.

IBM X-Force ID: 199398.\n\n- CVE-2021-28544: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 212038\n\n- CVE-2021-39013: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.7.2.0, 1.7.1.0, and 1.7.0.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in HTTP responses that could be used in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 213651.\n\n- CVE-2021-41767: Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users.

A remote attacker may be able to leak memory.\n\n- CVE-2021-32032: In Trusted Firmware-M through 1.3.0, cleaning up the memory allocated for a multi-part cryptographic operation (in the event of a failure) can prevent the abort() operation in the associated cryptographic library from freeing internal resources, causing a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-39282: Live555 through 1.08 has a memory leak in AC3AudioStreamParser for AC3 files.\n\n- CVE-2021-41229: BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.\n\n- CVE-2021-42340: The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to 9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a memory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade connections was not released for WebSocket connections once the connection was closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.\n\n- CVE-2021-20265: A flaw was found in the way memory resources were freed in the unix_stream_recvmsg function in the Linux kernel when a signal was pending. This flaw allows an unprivileged local user to crash the system by exhausting available memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34792: A vulnerability in the memory management of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper resource management when connection rates are high. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-28665: Stormshield SNS with versions before 3.7.18, 3.11.6 and 4.1.6 has a memory-management defect in the SNMP plugin that can lead to excessive consumption of memory and CPU resources, and possibly a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3181: rfc822.c in Mutt through 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mailbox unavailability) by sending email messages with sequences of semicolon characters in RFC822 address fields (aka terminators of empty groups). A small email message from the attacker can cause large memory consumption, and the victim may then be unable to see email messages from other persons.\n\n- CVE-2021-41145: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-31261: The gf_hinter_track_new function in GPAC 1.0.1 allows attackers to read memory via a crafted file in the MP4Box command.\n\n- CVE-2020-22844: A buffer overflow in Mikrotik RouterOS 6.47 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via crafted SMB requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-40008: There is a memory leak vulnerability in CloudEngine 12800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 5800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 6800 V200R019C00SPC800 and CloudEngine 7800 V200R019C00SPC800. The software does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory while parse a series of crafted binary messages, which could consume remaining memory. Successful exploit could cause memory exhaust.\n\n- CVE-2022-20046: In Bluetooth, there is a possible memory corruption due to a logic error. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06142410; Issue ID: ALPS06142410.\n\n- CVE-2021-33437: An issue was discovered in mjs (mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine), ES6 (JavaScript version 6). There are memory leaks in frozen_cb() in mjs.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-42197: An issue was discovered in swftools through 20201222 through a memory leak in the swftools when swfdump is used. It allows an attacker to cause code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0854: A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n\n- CVE-2022-22155: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the handling of IPv6 neighbor state change events in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) of an ACX5448 router. The continuous flapping of an IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE restart to restore service. The following error messages will be seen after the FPC resources have been exhausted: fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 fpc0 DNX_NH::dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install(),3135: dnx_nh_tag_ipv4_hw_install: BCM L3 Egress create object failed for NH 602 (-14:No resources for operation), BCM NH Params: unit:0 Port:41, L3_INTF:0 Flags: 0x40 This issue only affects the ACX5448 router.

It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-38178: By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed EdDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-23471: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c. This issue was caused by the incorrect use of libxml2 API. The vendor forgot to call 'g_free()' to release the return value of 'xmlGetProp()'.\n\n- CVE-2021-42523: There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec' is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.\n\n- CVE-2022-26365: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2021-3690: A flaw was found in Undertow. A buffer leak on the incoming WebSocket PONG message may lead to memory exhaustion. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38371: A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE MBC (PPC) (BACnet) (All versions), APOGEE MBC (PPC) (P2 Ethernet) (All versions), APOGEE MEC (PPC) (BACnet) (All versions), APOGEE MEC (PPC) (P2 Ethernet) (All versions), APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.21), APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.21), Desigo PXC00-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC00-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC001-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC100-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC12-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC128-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC200-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC22-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC22.1-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC36.1-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC50-E.D (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXC64-U (All versions >= V2.3), Desigo PXM20-E (All versions >= V2.3), Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V1 (All versions < V5.2a), Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V2 (All versions < V5.4), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2012 (All versions < V2012.08.1), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2017 (All versions < V2017.02.4), Nucleus Source Code (All versions including affected FTP server), TALON TC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7), TALON TC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.7). The FTP server does not properly release memory resources that were reserved for incomplete connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial of service condition on devices that incorporate a vulnerable version of the FTP server.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-772 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-404 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-404 (ChildOf)",

Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability.

When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration.

(The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.

The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace.

Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4 or newer.\n\n- CVE-2022-41944: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

        "matched_text": "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nAlternative Terms:\n\nResource Exhaustion\n\nResource Exhaustion\n\nResource Exhaustion\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nLimited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message: \"DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET: Warning: Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNH:aggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc <fpc number> for <n> times, started at <timestamp>\" This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-22119: Spring Security versions 5.5.x prior to 5.5.1, 5.4.x prior to 5.4.7, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.10 and 5.2.x prior to 5.2.11 are susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via the initiation of the Authorization Request in an OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application. A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform. An attacker can use this flaw to trick a user, with privileges to pull container images, into crashing the process responsible for pulling the image. This flaw affects containers-image versions before 5.2.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-1750: A flaw was found in the machine-config-operator that causes an OpenShift node to become unresponsive when a container consumes a large amount of memory. An attacker could use this flaw to deny access to schedule new pods in the OpenShift cluster. This was fixed in openshift/machine-config-operator 4.4.3, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.3.25, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.2.36.\n\n- CVE-2020-20217: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/route process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/cerm process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20230: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the sshd process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20248: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the memtest process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-25242: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Advanced (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Lean (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Standard (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions). Specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 102 could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on the affected devices. A cold restart might be necessary in order to recover.\n\n- CVE-2020-28944: OX Guard 2.10.4 and earlier allows a Denial of Service via a WKS server that responds slowly or with a large amount of data.\n\n- CVE-2020-35498: A vulnerability was found in openvswitch. A limitation in the implementation of userspace packet parsing can allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted packet causing the resulting megaflow in the kernel to be too wide, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-35510: A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001. A malicious attacker could cause threads to hold up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the EJB client code resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-36332: A flaw was found in libwebp in versions before 1.0.1. When reading a file libwebp allocates an excessive amount of memory.

Note that the attacker must be in the same Layer 2 network segment as the vulnerable appliance.\n\n- CVE-2020-9000: An issue was discovered in iPortalis iCS 7.1.13.0. Attackers can send a sequence of requests to rapidly cause .NET Input Validation errors. This increases the size of the log file on the remote server until memory is exhausted, therefore consuming the maximum amount of resources (triggering a denial of service condition).\n\n- CVE-2021-0008: Uncontrolled resource consumption in firmware for Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters 800 Series Controllers and associated adapters before version 1.5.3.0 may allow privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0180: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel(R) HAXM software before version 7.6.6 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable privilege escalation via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0182: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel(R) HAXM software before version 7.6.6 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0229: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause MQTT server to crash and restart leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a stream of specific packets. A Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) application designed with a listening port uses the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect to a mosquitto broker that is running on Junos OS to subscribe for events. Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1R1 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S4; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S1, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S2, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.

Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.\n\n- CVE-2021-39171: Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication library. Prior to version 3.1.0, a malicious SAML payload can require transforms that consume significant system resources to process, thereby resulting in reduced or denied service. This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack. This has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.\n\n- CVE-2021-21369: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-21529: Dell System Update (DSU) 1.9 and earlier versions contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run out of memory by running multiple instances of the vulnerable application.\n\n- CVE-2021-21728: A ZTE product has a configuration error vulnerability. Because a certain port is open by default, an attacker can consume system processing resources by flushing a large number of packets to the port, and successfully exploiting this vulnerability could reduce system processing capabilities. This affects: ZXA10 C300M all versions up to V4.3P8.\n\n- CVE-2021-22010: The vCenter Server contains a denial-of-service vulnerability in VPXD service.

Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to the library, but the server application never receives them. This is patched in version 4.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2020-21573: An issue was discoverered in in abhijitnathwani image-processing v0.1.0, allows local attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted image file.\n\n- CVE-2020-26257: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. Synapse is a reference \"homeserver\" implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1.

In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.\n\n- CVE-2022-31030: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device.

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-25458: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ION driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25462: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in NPU driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25491: A vulnerability in mfc driver prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows memory corruption via NULL-pointer dereference.\n\n- CVE-2021-32282: An issue was discovered in gravity through 0.8.1. A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function ircode_add_check() located in gravity_ircode.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37639: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3119: Zetetic SQLCipher 4.x before 4.4.3 has a NULL pointer dereferencing issue related to sqlcipher_export in crypto.c and sqlite3StrICmp in sqlite3.c.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus. Flask-RESTX before version 0.5.1 is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in email_regex. This is fixed in version 0.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-32839: sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In sqlparse versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of Service in sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause exponential backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of '\\\\r\\\\n' in SQL comments. Only the formatting feature that removes comments from SQL statements is affected by this regular expression. As a workaround don't use the sqlformat.format function with keyword strip_comments=True or the --strip-comments command line flag when using the sqlformat command line tool. The issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33503: An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5. When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.\n\n- CVE-2021-33580: User controlled `request.getHeader(\"Referer\")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33623: The trim-newlines package before 3.0.1 and 4.x before 4.0.1 for Node.js has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for the .end() method.\n\n- CVE-2021-36716: A ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) flaw was found in the Segment is-email package before 1.0.1 for Node.js.

In affected versions unsanitised input of regular expression date within the parameters of the DPL parser function, allowed for the possibility of ReDoS (Regex Denial of Service). This has been resolved in version 3.3.6. If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\n\n- CVE-2021-42836: GJSON before 1.9.3 allows a ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-44686: calibre before 5.32.0 contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in html_preprocess_rules in ebooks/conversion/preprocess.py.\n\n- CVE-2020-1920: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the validateBaseUrl function can cause the application to use excessive resources, become unresponsive, or crash.

The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21267: Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS objects (npm package schema-inspector). In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-21306: Marked is an open-source markdown parser and compiler (npm package \"marked\"). In marked from version 1.1.1 and before version 2.0.0, there is a Regular expression Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability can affect anyone who runs user generated code through marked.

The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n- CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38244: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exits in cbioportal 3.6.21 and older via a POST request to /ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json.\n\n- CVE-2021-39917: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.9 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. A regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking that could cause a DOS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-43854: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.\n\n- CVE-2022-31147: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms. Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306.

Specially crafted Content Types may cause catastrophic backtracking, taking exponential time to complete. Specifically, this is about the regular expression used on the parameter of the org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered by web requests in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry codepath passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor.\n\n- CVE-2022-34402: Dell Wyse ThinOS 2205 contains a Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability in UI.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

CVE-2022-23042\n\n- CVE-2022-23041: Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.

The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

These ranges are usually defined using special range registers that contain information, such as base address and size. Address decoding is the process of determining for which range the incoming transaction is destined. To ensure isolation, ranges containing secret data are access-control protected.\n\n\nOccasionally, these ranges could overlap. The overlap could either be intentional (e.g. due to a limited number of range registers or limited choice in choosing size of the range) or unintentional (e.g. introduced by errors). Some hardware designs allow dynamic remapping of address ranges assigned to peripheral MMIO ranges. In such designs, intentional address overlaps can be created through misconfiguration by malicious software. When protected and unprotected ranges overlap, an attacker could send a transaction and potentially compromise the protections in place, violating the principle of least privilege. \n",
