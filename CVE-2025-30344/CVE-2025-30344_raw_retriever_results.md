# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-30344
## Query
An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. During login at the /system/auth/login/ endpoint, the systems response times differ depending on whether a user exists in the system. The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password (e.g., more than 100 milliseconds).

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'omitted hashing of the password'
