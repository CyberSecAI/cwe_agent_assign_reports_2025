  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-47796 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE Description:** The provided content includes the CVE description: \"OFFIS DCMTK nowindow improper array index validation vulnerability. A specially crafted DICOM file can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\"\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when rendering invalid monochrome DICOM images. Specifically, when the number of pixels stored is less than expected, the remaining pixel matrix is filled with a default value (initially 0, changed to the smallest possible value in the fix). This can lead to memory problems detected by AddressSanitizer (ASAN).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper array index validation.\n*   Out-of-bounds write.\n*   Heap-use-after-free (as reported by ASAN).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Memory corruption.\n*   Potential for crashes.\n*   The ASAN report suggests a heap-use-after-free condition, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution (though this is not explicitly stated).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Providing a specially crafted DICOM file to a system using a vulnerable version of DCMTK.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DICOM file to the target system. This could be through network transfer, file upload, or other means of file delivery.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability has been patched in DCMTK. The commit hash for the fix is `89a6e399f1e17d08a8bc8cdaa05b2ac9a50cd4f6`.\n*   The fix changes how the remaining pixel matrix is filled when the stored number of pixels is less than expected, using the smallest possible value instead of 0.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `nowindow` function within the DCMTK code.\n*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing monochrome images.\n*   The ASAN report provides detailed information about the memory corruption, including the addresses involved and the call stack.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos.\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as TALOS-2024-2122.\n*   The vulnerable version is DCMTK 3.6.8.\n*   The CVSSv3 score is 8.4 (High).\n*   The CWE is CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).",
