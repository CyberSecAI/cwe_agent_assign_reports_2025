# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-47687

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vdpa/mlx5 Fix **invalid mr resource destroy** Certain error paths from mlx5_vdpa_dev_add() can end up releasing mr resources which never got initialized in the first place. This patch adds the **missing check** in mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() to block releasing non-initialized mr resources. Reference trace mlx5_core 00000800.2 mlx5_vdpa_dev_add3274(pid 2700) warning No mac address provisioned?
