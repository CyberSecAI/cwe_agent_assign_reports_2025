  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vdpa/mlx5 Fix **invalid mr resource destroy** Certain error paths from mlx5_vdpa_dev_add() can end up releasing mr resources which never got initialized in the first place.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-47687.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from missing checks in the `mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources()` function. Certain error paths within `mlx5_vdpa_dev_add()` can lead to the release of memory region (mr) resources that were never properly initialized.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Use-after-free or double-free:** The core issue is attempting to free memory resources (mr) that were not allocated or initialized. If certain error conditions occur during device setup, the teardown process tries to free these resources, resulting in a double-free or use-after-free scenario.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Kernel crash:** The provided reference trace demonstrates a kernel NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash, specifically in `vhost_iotlb_del_range`. This can lead to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Error conditions during device setup:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific error conditions occurring during the `mlx5_vdpa_dev_add()` function, which is part of the virtual data path accelerator (vdpa) device setup. This suggests that an attacker needs some control over vdpa device configuration or resource provisioning to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **vdpa device interaction:** It is likely an attacker would need to interact with the vdpa device through a virtualized environment, possibly using netlink commands to trigger the error condition.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Privileged access:** The attacker would likely need some level of privilege or control over the virtualized environment to trigger the error during device setup.  The crash occurs in kernel space, indicating a privileged context is involved in triggering this bug.\n- **vdpa specific setup:** The attacker would need the ability to configure or manipulate vdpa devices or resources to reach the vulnerable code path.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The fix adds a check to verify if the `mvdev->res.valid` flag is set before attempting to release the memory resources inside the `mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources()` function.\n- The issue was detected from a kernel crash report demonstrating the NULL pointer dereference.\n- The fix has been backported to multiple stable kernel branches.\n- The issue relates to memory management within the Mellanox (mlx5) virtual data path acceleration driver.",

This leads to the attempted release of uninitialized memory resources (**CWE-404**), and potentially a **NULL pointer dereference** (**CWE-476**) when the code tries to access the uninitialized memory, causing a kernel panic or \"Oops\".\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing initialization** of memory resources, as highlighted by the keyphrase \"missing check\". While the code attempts to free these uninitialized resources, this is a consequence of the initial error. The high retriever scores for **CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource)** supports this assessment. The 'Oops' impact described in the vulnerability reinforces the likelihood of a **CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)**. **CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release)** is included because the uninitialized resources are attempted to be released.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**missing check**\" and \"**invalid mr resource destroy**\", strongly supports the selection of **CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource)** as the primary CWE. The subsequent crash, indicated by \"Oops\", further suggests a **CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)** stemming from the initial **missing initialization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nI considered **CWE-667 (Improper Locking)**, but it is less relevant as the core issue is not related to locking mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release)** is included because the vulnerability involves releasing memory resources that were never initialized.\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource)** is the primary CWE because the core issue is the lack of resource initialization.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nI considered **CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer)** but it is more of a consequence of CWE-909, as the code attempts to access memory that was not initialized, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
