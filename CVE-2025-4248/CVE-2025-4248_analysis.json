  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester Simple To-Do List System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /complete_task.php. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-4248. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nOn the ninth line of the `complete_task.php` file, `$id` is used to retrieve user input and execute it, which may lead to SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain database privileges, potentially leading to access to a large amount of data or even server host privileges if the database has DBA privileges.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the `complete_task.php` file. A proof of concept (POC) is provided using `sqlmap`: `python3 sqlmap.py -u <http://localhost/complete_task.php?id=1> --dbms=mysql --technique=T`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the `complete_task.php` endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies the need to sanitize or properly validate user input before using it in SQL queries.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a specific vulnerable file, a POC exploit command, and a description of the potential impact. It also identifies the affected product as \"Simple To-Do List System\".",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the ID argument leads to **SQL Injection**. The CVE summary confirms that user input is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89 (Base). There are other related CWEs, mainly involving the neutralization of input. However, the direct evidence points strongly to **SQL injection** as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input** leading to **SQL injection**. The chain is as follows:\n\n1.  **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (ID argument).\n2.  **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The unsanitized input is directly used in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description key phrases (\"**SQL injection**\", \"manipulation of argument ID\") and the CVE reference content summary that pinpoints the **lack of sanitization** in `complete_task.php`. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-89 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"SQL injection\". The CWE description and its relationships with other CWEs (like CWE-74 and CWE-79) further support this choice. CWE-89 is also a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nOther considered CWEs:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While input neutralization is a concern, the specific vulnerability is SQL injection, making CWE-79 less relevant.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs): The vulnerability is not related to logging.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This is not relevant because the application is not using a template engine in a vulnerable manner.",
