Unauthenticated attackers can directly access sensitive database backup files (snapshot_users.db) via publicly exposed URLs (/logs/devcfg/snapshot/ and /logs/devcfg/user/). Exploiting this vulnerability allows retrieval of sensitive user data, including login credentials, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
