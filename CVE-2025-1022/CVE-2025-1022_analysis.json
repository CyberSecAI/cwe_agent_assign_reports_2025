  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-1022: Improper Input Validation in Browsershot\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `setHtml()` function in Browsershot < 5.0.5 does not properly validate user-supplied HTML content, specifically failing to adequately block file URI schemes (e.g., `file://`, `file:/`). An attacker can bypass this validation by omitting slashes in the file URI (e.g., `file:../../../../etc/passwd`).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Arbitrary file read on the system running Browsershot.\n*   Potential system directory listing.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious HTML document containing a file URI scheme to read arbitrary files on the server.\n*   The vulnerability can be exploited through the `Browsershot::html()` function.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to supply HTML content to the `Browsershot::html()` function. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade `spatie/browsershot` to version 5.0.5 or higher. The commit `bcfd608b264fab654bf78e199bdfbb03e9323eb7` and `e3273974506865a24fbb5b65b534d8d4b8dfbf72` address this issue.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The Snyk assessment recommends a high severity (8.8).\n*   Proof-of-concept exploits are available.\n*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2025-1022.\n*   The EPSS percentile is 0.12% (33rd percentile).",

Since the description specifically mentions file URI schemes being bypassed due to **missing validation** (a root cause) leading to potential path traversal (an impact), I favored **CWE-20** as the primary weakness due to it being a general **Improper Input Validation** issue. **CWE-22** is a more specific Path Traversal issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20** (**Improper Input Validation**) due to the **missing validations** of file URI schemes. This leads to the possibility of **CWE-22** (**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**), enabling attackers to read arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The primary focus was on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description highlights **missing validations** as the primary issue, which directly corresponds to **CWE-20** (**Improper Input Validation**). The ability to bypass file URI schemes (e.g., `file:../../../../etc/passwd`) reinforces this assessment and also suggests **CWE-22** (**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**) as a secondary impact.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary is sufficient to support this classification. The CVE reference explicitly mentions **Improper Input Validation** (**CWE-20**) as a weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships helped solidify the decision to prioritize **CWE-20** as the primary weakness due to its broader scope and its role as the root cause. **CWE-22** is a possible consequence of the **Improper Input Validation**, making it a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-20** accurately captures the **missing validations** aspect, while **CWE-22** represents the potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
