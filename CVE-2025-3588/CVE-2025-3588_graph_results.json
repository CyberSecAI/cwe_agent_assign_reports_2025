  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in joelittlejohn jsonschema2pojo 1.2.2. This issue affects the function apply of the file org/jsonschema2pojo/rules/SchemaRule.java of the component JSON File Handler. The manipulation leads to stack-based buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
