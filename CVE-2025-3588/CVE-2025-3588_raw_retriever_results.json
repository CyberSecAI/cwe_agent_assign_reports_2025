This issue affects the function apply of the file org/jsonschema2pojo/rules/SchemaRule.java of the component JSON File Handler. The manipulation leads to stack-based buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
