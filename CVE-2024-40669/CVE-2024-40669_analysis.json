The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**use after free** due to a **race condition**.\" CWE-362, **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**, is a Class-level CWE that describes the **race condition** contributing to the **use after free**. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416. This aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), which allows a memory location to be freed while another thread is still using it, leading to a **use after free** condition (CWE-416). The impact is local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **use after free** caused by a **race condition**, leading to local privilege escalation. The retriever results list CWE-362 and CWE-416 as high-scoring candidates.\n\nCWE-416 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**use after free**\". CWE-362 is included because the **race condition** is a prerequisite for the **use after free**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
