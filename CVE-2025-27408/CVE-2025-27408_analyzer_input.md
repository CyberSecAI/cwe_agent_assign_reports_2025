# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-27408

## Vulnerability Description
Manifest offers users a one-file micro back end. Prior to version 4.9.2, Manifest employs a **weak password hashing implementation** that uses SHA3 without a salt. This exposes user passwords to a higher risk of being cracked if an attacker gains access to the database. Without the use of a salt, identical passwords across multiple users will result in the same hash, making it easier for attackers to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking process. Version 4.9.2 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak password hashing implementation**
- **product:** Manifest
- **version:** Prior to version 4.9.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27408 Content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on details relevant to CVE-2025-27408, as described in the prompt's guidelines:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-27408, as it explicitly mentions the CVE ID. The description details a vulnerability concerning weak password hashing in the "manifest" package.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses SHA3 for password hashing *without* a salt.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Use of a one-way hash (SHA3) without a salt.
    *   Deterministic password hashes (identical passwords result in identical hashes).
    *   Cryptographic weakness.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Increased risk of password cracking if the database is compromised.
    *   Attackers can use precomputed hash databases (Rainbow Tables) or brute-force attacks more effectively.
    *   Compromised accounts and potential for further system exploitation.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Database breach (attacker gains access to the password hashes).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Access to the application's database.
    *   Knowledge of password cracking techniques.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The advisory does not specify a fix, but implies that implementing a salted hash function (like bcrypt, as mentioned in the first commit analyzed) is the solution.

**3. Additional Details (More than CVE Description):**

*   **Affected versions:** `< 4.9.2`
*   **CVSS Score:** 4.8 (Moderate)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Credits:** The vulnerability was reported by @prokofitch.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The advisory provides a PoC: create two users with the same password, extract their hashes, and verify they are identical.
*   **CWE ID:** CWE-759 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)

**4. Content Source:**

The information is sourced from a GitHub security advisory for the "manifest" package.
