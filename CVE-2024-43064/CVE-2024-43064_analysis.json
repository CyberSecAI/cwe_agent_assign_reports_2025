CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, and while it's a good starting point given the \"uncontrolled resource consumption\" root cause, there might be more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that fit. CWE-1262 is related to access control issues when using a register interface. While not a direct child of CWE-400, it suggests a potential access control problem contributes to resource consumption, making it a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1262[\"CWE-1262: Improper Access Control for Register Interface\"]\n    \n    cwe1262 -->|RELATED| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1262 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a driver, application, or SMMU client attempting to access global registers via SMMU. The **root cause** is **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The primary impact is likely denial of service or system instability due to resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points towards **uncontrolled resource consumption**, making CWE-400 a strong candidate. The description states \"Uncontrolled resource consumption when a driver, an application or a SMMU client tries to access the global registers through SMMU\" which directly reflects the definition of CWE-400.\n\nHowever, the mention of \"global registers through SMMU\" hints at a possible issue with access control to these registers. Thus, CWE-1262, \"Improper Access Control for Register Interface,\" was considered as a secondary weakness that could contribute to the primary weakness of uncontrolled resource consumption. While CWE-400 is a Class, the specificity of the description doesn't allow for a more precise Base or Variant level CWE. CWE-1262 is at the Base level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric

appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 347.88\n**Source**:
