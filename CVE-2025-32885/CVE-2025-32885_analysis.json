The app allows injection of custom messages (into existing v1 networks) with any GID and Callsign via a software defined radio. This can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign values using a software-defined radio.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak Authentication (CWE-1390).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** High confidentiality impact. An attacker can inject messages into the network.\n\n**Attack vectors:** CVSS Score 6.5 - CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:A/A:N/C:H/I:N/PR:N/S:U/UI:N (Attack Complexity: Low, Attack Vector: Adjacent, Attack Requirements: None, Confidentiality Impact: High, Integrity Impact: None, Privileges Required: None, User Interaction: None).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Adjacent network access and a software-defined radio.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:** The vendor discontinued support for goTenna v1 in 2024. The vulnerability was reported in 2017 and 2018, and a fix was implemented for the goTenna Pro, but not for the v1.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Affected Products: goTenna (v1) - goTenna App version 5.5.3, goTenna (v1) firmware version 0.25.5\n*   The issue was discovered and reported in 2017 and 2018.\n*   The vendor discontinued the entire civilian market, including goTenna v1 and Mesh devices.\n*   Discoverers: Dale Wooden, Tim Kuester, Erwin Karincic.\n*   Reference: <https://gotenna.com>",

While more specific base-level CWEs could exist under CWE-1390, none were identified that precisely fit the vulnerability description. CWE-941 is related because the attacker is able to inject a message with any GID and Callsign.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    \n    cwe941\n    cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1390 primary\n    class cwe941 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **weak authentication** (CWE-1390), which allows an attacker to inject messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign. This leads to the ability to inject messages by **incorrectly specifying the destination** (CWE-941).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the goTenna v1 device is vulnerable to message injection due to a **lack of proper authentication** and authorization mechanisms. The ability to inject custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign values highlights a significant weakness in the authentication process.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1390 is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which explicitly mentions \"Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)\" as a present weakness/vulnerability. The description of the vulnerability aligns with the characteristics of CWE-1390, where the system fails to adequately verify the identity of the message source, allowing unauthorized message injection.\n\nThe inclusion of CWE-941 is to account for the attacker's ability to inject messages by **incorrectly specifying the destination** in the communication channel.\n\nThe confidence level is medium because although the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions \"Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)\", the vulnerability description itself doesn't explicitly state the authentication mechanism that is broken. The evidence supporting the root cause focuses on message injection with arbitrary identifiers, rather than a detailed flaw in the authentication implementation itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
