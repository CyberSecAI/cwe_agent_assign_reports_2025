# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-7039

## Description

In open-webui/open-webui version v0.3.8, there is an **improper privilege management** vulnerability. The application allows an attacker, acting as an admin, to delete other administrators via the API endpoint `http//0.0.0.08080/api/v1/users/{uuid_administrator}`. This action is restricted by the user interface but can be performed through direct API calls.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper privilege management
- **Vector:** direct API calls
- **Product:** open-webui/open-webui
- **Impact:** delete other administrators, delete users
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Version:** v0.3.8

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The application performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. |
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | The product does not properly check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), providing a more specific classification than its parent. CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is a related, but less specific, classification, as it describes a broader class of privilege-related issues. The choice of CWE-863 over CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is based on the fact that the authorization check exists but is implemented incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves an **improper privilege management** issue leading to **incorrect authorization**, allowing an attacker to delete other administrators via a direct API call.

Initial Flaw: **Improper privilege management** allows an attacker to act as admin.
|
Incorrect Authorization: The application fails to correctly authorize the deletion of other administrators.
|
Impact: An attacker can delete other administrators.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered the high retriever scores of CWE-863, CWE-285, and CWE-639. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**improper privilege management**", suggesting a problem with privilege handling. However, the ability to bypass authorization and delete other administrators points more directly to incorrect authorization.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE because the application performs an authorization check, but it is not correctly implemented, allowing an attacker acting as an admin to delete other administrators.

CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is considered as a secondary CWE, as the root cause is **improper privilege management** allowing the attacker to assume an admin role in the first place, which then leads to the authorization bypass.

These CWEs provide a good level of specificity, describing both the root cause (**improper privilege management**) and the immediate vulnerability (**incorrect authorization**). The selection is based on the provided evidence and is further supported by the retriever results.

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
