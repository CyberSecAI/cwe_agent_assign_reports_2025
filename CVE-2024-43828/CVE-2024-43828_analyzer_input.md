# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43828

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix infinite loop when replaying fast_commit When doing fast_commit replay an infinite loop may occur due to an **uninitialized extent_status struct**. ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole() does not detect the replay and calls ext4_es_find_extent_range(), which will return immediately without initializing the es variable. Because es contains garbage, an **integer overflow** may happen causing an infinite loop in this function, easily reproducible using fstest generic/039. This commit fixes this issue by unconditionally initializing the structure in function ext4_es_find_extent_range(). Thanks to Zhang Yi, for figuring out the real problem!

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized extent_status struct**
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** infinite loop
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ext4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-43828.

**Root Cause:**
An uninitialized `extent_status` struct during fast commit replay in the ext4 filesystem can lead to an infinite loop. Specifically, `ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole()` does not detect the replay, and calls `ext4_es_find_extent_range()`. This function returns without initializing the 'es' variable. Since `es` contains garbage data, an integer overflow can occur causing an infinite loop.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Uninitialized variable: The `extent_status` struct is not properly initialized during fast commit replay, which leads to undefined behavior
- Integer overflow: Garbage data in the `es` struct can result in an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An infinite loop can occur during fast commit replay, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the fast commit replay process in the ext4 filesystem. It can be reproduced using the `fstest generic/039` test.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to trigger a fast commit replay operation on an ext4 filesystem to exploit this vulnerability.
