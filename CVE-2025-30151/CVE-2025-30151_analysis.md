# Analysis for CVE-2025-30151

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 0.4 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-400 and its potential children. While more specific children of CWE-400 might exist, the description doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint a more precise weakness. CWE-1333 was considered because the long passwords may be processed using regular expressions, leading to inefficiency and resource exhaustion.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **passing long passwords** (input) which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and results in **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness due to the direct mention of Denial of Service, which is a common impact of uncontrolled resource consumption. The **root cause** is the **acceptance of excessively long passwords**, leading to resource exhaustion.

The evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases "**passing long passwords** that leads to Denial Of Service" and "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability," strongly supports this classification. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further validates this by stating, "Passing long passwords to forms in Storefront or Store-API" as the root cause and "Denial of Service" as the impact.

CWE-1333 was considered as a secondary factor because it is possible the passwords were being processed using an inefficient regular expression.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because the description focuses on the high-level impact of resource consumption without providing specific details about the underlying cause beyond the **passing of long passwords**.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected:* This is not related to the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description does not describe immutable parameters.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not selected:* This is not related to the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description does not describe credential issues, but password length.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
