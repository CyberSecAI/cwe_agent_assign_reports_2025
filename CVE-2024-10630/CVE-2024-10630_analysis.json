Several potential child CWEs exist, such as CWE-367, CWE-364, CWE-366, CWE-368, and CWE-1298, which represent more specific types of race conditions.

This leads to the ability for a local authenticated attacker to bypass the application blocking functionality. The description only highlights the initial weakness and the final impact, without specifying the intermediate steps.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **race condition** that allows bypassing application blocking. The primary evidence is the phrase \"**race condition**\" in the description. The best match from the retriever results is CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')), which is a Class-level CWE. While more specific CWEs exist for different types of race conditions (e.g., CWE-367, CWE-364), the provided information doesn't contain enough details to determine the specific type of **race condition**. Therefore, CWE-362 is the most appropriate choice. The confidence is relatively high (0.8) because the description explicitly mentions \"**race condition**\", but the evidence strength is low because the reference links content summary is unrelated.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) **Race Condition**): Considered, but there's no specific evidence to suggest a TOCTOU vulnerability.\n*   CWE-364 (Signal Handler **Race Condition**): Considered, but no evidence of signal handlers being involved.\n*   CWE-366 (**Race Condition** within a Thread): Considered, but the description doesn't specify whether the **race condition** occurs within a thread.\n*   CWE-368 (Context Switching **Race Condition**): Considered, but there is no context switching.\n*   CWE-421 (**Race Condition** During Access to Alternate Channel): Considered, but there is no alternate channel.\n*   CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization): Considered, but CWE-362 is more specific, covering concurrent execution with improper synchronization.\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking): Considered, but the description doesn't specifically point to a locking issue, only a general **race condition**.\n*   CWE-1298 (Hardware Logic Contains **Race Conditions**): Considered, but this vulnerability is in software, not hardware logic.",
