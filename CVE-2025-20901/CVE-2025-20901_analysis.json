The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds read**, which directly matches this CWE. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-125 is a specific type of memory access error. No other relationships strongly influence the decision in this case. The abstraction level is Base, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe125 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Out-of-bounds read** (**CWE-125**)\n2.  **Impact:** Allows local privileged attackers to read out-of-bounds memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, both of which explicitly mention \"**out-of-bounds read**\". The CWE-125 description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-125 as the top candidate. Therefore, CWE-125 is selected as the primary CWE with high confidence. It is a base level CWE and directly represents the **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly
