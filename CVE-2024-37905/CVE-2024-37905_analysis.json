  "description": "authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility. Authentik API-Access-Token mechanism can be exploited to gain admin user privileges. A successful exploit of the issue will result in a user gaining full admin access to the Authentik application, including resetting user passwords and more. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2024.2.4, 2024.4.2 and 2024.6.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-37905:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when creating or modifying API tokens. Specifically, an authenticated user could change the user ID associated with a token to that of a higher-privileged user.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Improper Authorization:** The system lacked proper authorization checks, allowing authenticated users to modify token associations in a way that elevates their privileges.\n- **Missing permission checks:** The core issue is the lack of adequate checks to prevent a user from modifying a token's associated user to another user with higher privileges.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** By changing the user ID of a token, an attacker can gain the higher-level access permissions of the target user, potentially reaching superuser level.\n- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can use the elevated privileges to access sensitive data or functionalities.\n- **System Compromise:** An attacker could change the password of the affected user, potentially locking them out of their account.\n- **Malicious Configuration Changes:** The attacker could modify the authentik configuration, causing potentially malicious consequences.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network using the API.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the system (low privilege).\n- **API Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the `/api/v3/core/tokens*` endpoint.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n- The issue was fixed in authentik versions 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3 and 2024.2.4.\n- A temporary workaround is to block requests to `/api/v3/core/tokens*` at the reverse proxy/load balancer level.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.8, with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.",

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, and the vulnerability details suggest that the authorization check was present but flawed, making CWE-863 the most appropriate high-level classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe863\n    cwe306 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** when creating or modifying API tokens (CWE-863). This leads to a privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain full admin access. The chain can be described as:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** **Insufficient permission checks** when creating/modifying API tokens.\n2.  **Privilege Escalation:** User gains admin privileges.\n3.  **Unauthorized Access:** Attacker accesses sensitive data/functionalities.\n4.  **System Compromise:** Attacker changes passwords or modifies system configuration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description pointed towards authorization issues related to API tokens. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary solidified this by explicitly stating **\"Improper Authorization\"** due to **\"insufficient permission checks\"**. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), represents the flawed authorization logic that allows users to modify token associations and escalate their privileges. The evidence states: \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when creating or modifying API tokens. Specifically, an authenticated user could change the user ID associated with a token to that of a higher-privileged user.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** mechanism. While other CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) exist, CWE-863 is more precise in describing the **incorrect** nature of the authorization process, rather than its mere absence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
