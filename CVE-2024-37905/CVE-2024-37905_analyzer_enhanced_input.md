## Vulnerability Description
authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility. Authentik API-Access-Token mechanism can be exploited to gain admin user privileges. A successful exploit of the issue will result in a user gaining full admin access to the Authentik application, including resetting user passwords and more. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2024.2.4, 2024.4.2 and 2024.6.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** gain full admin access to the Authentik application
- **vector:** API-Access-Token mechanism
- **product:** authentik

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-37905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when creating or modifying API tokens. Specifically, an authenticated user could change the user ID associated with a token to that of a higher-privileged user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The system lacked proper authorization checks, allowing authenticated users to modify token associations in a way that elevates their privileges.
- **Missing permission checks:** The core issue is the lack of adequate checks to prevent a user from modifying a token's associated user to another user with higher privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By changing the user ID of a token, an attacker can gain the higher-level access permissions of the target user, potentially reaching superuser level.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can use the elevated privileges to access sensitive data or functionalities.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could change the password of the affected user, potentially locking them out of their account.
- **Malicious Configuration Changes:** The attacker could modify the authentik configuration, causing potentially malicious consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network using the API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the system (low privilege).
- **API Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the `/api/v3/core/tokens*` endpoint.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
- The issue was fixed in authentik versions 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3 and 2024.2.4.
- A temporary workaround is to block requests to `/api/v3/core/tokens*` at the reverse proxy/load balancer level.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.8, with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
