CWE-269 is a class-level CWE that describes improper privilege management. While the vulnerability description indicates that authenticated users can read arbitrary files with root access, the root cause seems to stem from how privileges are managed within the application. CWE-200 is included as a secondary candidate because the end result is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|IMPACT| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper privilege management** (CWE-269), leading to the ability for remote authenticated users to **read arbitrary files**, which can be classified as **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that \"Infoblox NETMRI before 7.6.1 has a vulnerability allowing remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files with root access.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-269 is based on the understanding that the root cause of the vulnerability lies in how the application manages user privileges. Authenticated users should not be able to read arbitrary files with root access, indicating a flaw in the privilege management system. The impact of this **improper privilege management** is the exposure of sensitive information, which is why CWE-200 is also considered.\n\nGiven the limited information, the confidence level is moderate. Further investigation into the specific code implementation would be required to confirm the root cause and identify more specific CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
