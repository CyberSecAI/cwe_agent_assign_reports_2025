# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9749

## Description

Tungsten Automation Power PDF PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24465.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read']
- **Impact:** ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code']
- **Vector:** malicious page or file

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name   | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-125, which describes an out-of-bounds read. CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-125, representing the broader issue of failing to validate input properly. The vulnerability description highlights both the **out-of-bounds read** and the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. Therefore, both CWEs are applicable.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20). This leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) during PDF file parsing. The impact is **information disclosure**, and potentially, arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, focusing on the root cause and weakness. The description clearly states "**Out-Of-Bounds Read**" and "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**". The retriever results also list CWE-125, CWE-20, and other related CWEs.

The primary CWE is CWE-125 because the vulnerability description specifically mentions an "Out-Of-Bounds Read". The secondary CWE is CWE-20, as the **lack of proper validation** is the root cause that allows the out-of-bounds read to occur. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

The relationship between CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is that CWE-125 is a child of CWE-20. This reflects the fact that an out-of-bounds read can occur because of improper input validation.

The evidence explicitly mentions the "Out-Of-Bounds Read" and the "lack of proper validation of user-supplied data," which aligns with CWE-125 and CWE-20.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.



## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
