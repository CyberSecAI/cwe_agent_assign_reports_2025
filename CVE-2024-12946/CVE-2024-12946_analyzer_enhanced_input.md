## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/admin_action.php. The manipulation of the argument admin_user_name leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/admin_action.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12946 (though not explicitly stated, this analysis is based on the assumption that this is related to the provided github content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the `admin_user_name` parameter in the `/admin/admin_action.php` file is directly inserted into SQL queries without any validation or escaping of special characters. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, categorized as both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
    - **Boolean-based blind:** Attackers can construct SQL queries that return true or false results, allowing them to infer database information bit by bit.
    - **Time-based blind:** Attackers can inject SQL queries that cause delays (using functions like `SLEEP`), allowing them to infer information based on response times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Read or Modify Sensitive Data:** Attackers can potentially access, alter, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Escalate Privileges:** Attackers may be able to gain higher-level database permissions or system access.
- **Interrupt Services:** Malicious queries can degrade application performance or cause crashes.
- **Compromise System Integrity:** Attackers may use the database breach as a stepping stone to further compromise the server or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/admin/admin_action.php` endpoint.
- Attackers craft malicious input within the `admin_user_name` parameter.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application.
- No special privileges or system access is required, as the vulnerability is accessible without authentication.

**Additional Details (from GitHub Content):**
- The vulnerable application is identified as the "Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project v1.0".
- The specific vulnerable file is `/admin/admin_action.php`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using automated tools such as `sqlmap`.
- Example payloads for both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection are provided.
- Screenshots from the test exploitation using SQLMap are also provided, showing successful database enumeration.
- The following remediation steps are suggested:
    - Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid direct embedding of input into SQL.
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided inputs.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege for database user permissions.
    - Perform regular security testing.
