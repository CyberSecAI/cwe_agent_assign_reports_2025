  "description": "WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 3.2.15 of the WeGIA application, `importar_dump.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. The command is basically a command to move a temporary file, so a webshell upload is also possible. Version 3.2.15 contains a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27140 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-27140. It details a critical OS Command Injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application, specifically in the `importar_dump.php` endpoint. The content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being used in a `shell_exec` call. Specifically, the `$_FILES[\"import\"][\"tmp_name\"]` and `$_FILES[\"import\"][\"name\"]` values are directly concatenated into a shell command without proper escaping or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The primary vulnerability.\n*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-284):** Lack of validation on the uploaded file name and type.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information from the system.\n*   **Web Server Takeover:**  An attacker could gain full control of the web server.\n*   **Cryptomining/Malware Installation:** The attacker can install malicious software.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can upload a malicious file with a crafted filename (e.g., `a;sleep 5` or a filename containing a reverse shell command) through the `importar_dump.php` endpoint.\n*   The vulnerability can be exploited even without being logged in due to a header issue (specifically related to PHP version 7.3.30).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   Ability to upload a file to the server.\n*   No authentication is required due to the identified header issue.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe advisory states that the vulnerability was patched in version 3.2.15. The commit message associated with the advisory (7d0df8c) indicates that the fix involves adding file type verification and MIME type checking to the `importar_dump.php` file. Specifically:\n\n*   Checking the file extension to ensure it's `dump.tar.gz`.\n*   Verifying the MIME type against a list of allowed types (`application/x-gzip`, `application/gzip`, `application/x-tar`).\n*   Properly escaping the file name and path when constructing the shell command.",

CWE-78 is more specific to OS command injection, making it a better fit than CWE-77. CWE-434 is a peer of several other CWEs related to file handling, such as CWE-430 and CWE-436. It can precede CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path). The relationship to file upload and command execution makes CWE-434 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a dangerous file upload (CWE-434), which then leads to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) because the filename is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that CWE-78 is the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both point to the fact that the root cause is the **command injection** in the `importar_dump.php` endpoint. The `$_FILES[\"import\"][\"tmp_name\"]` and `$_FILES[\"import\"][\"name\"]` values are directly concatenated into a shell command without proper escaping or validation. The inclusion of CWE-434 as a secondary issue acknowledges the role of the file upload in enabling the command injection. The fix in version 3.2.15 also confirms the need for proper escaping of the filename.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and it accurately represents the vulnerability. The other CWEs in the Retriever Results were considered but deemed less relevant as they were either too general (CWE-77, CWE-138) or related to different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
