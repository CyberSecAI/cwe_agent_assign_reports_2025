## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11647 (based on the content from github.com)

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `admin/view-appointment.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project." The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `viewid` parameter before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `viewid` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain control of the system.
    *   **Service Interruption:** The system service could be disrupted.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin/view-appointment.php` file, manipulating the `viewid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any login or authorization, they can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `admin/view-appointment.php` file.
*   The `viewid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.
*   The provided SQLMap output indicates successful exploitation using a combination of those techniques.

**Mitigation:**

The suggested fixes include:

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. Prepared statements treat user inputs as data, not as executable SQL code.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validating and filtering all user inputs to ensure they match expected patterns or formats
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Using database accounts with minimal permissions for daily operation reduces the impact of a successful SQL injection.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Periodic security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
