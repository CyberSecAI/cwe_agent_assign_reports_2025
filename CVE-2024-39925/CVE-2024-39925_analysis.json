  "description": "An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39925:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of organization key rotation in Vaultwarden. When a user's access to an organization is revoked, the organization's symmetric encryption key is not updated. This allows a former member who retains a copy of the organization key to potentially access the organization's data even after their access is revoked. Additionally, the application does not properly protect encrypted user data, allowing an authenticated user to gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if they are not a member.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Organization Key Rotation:** The core issue is that when a user is removed from an organization, the organization's encryption key is not rotated, allowing former members to potentially decrypt the organization's data.\n*  **Insufficient Access Control:** Authenticated users can access the encrypted data of organizations they are not members of, violating expected access control restrictions.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Former organization members can decrypt and access all of the organization's data, including new secrets added after their access revocation. This includes secrets, notes, and other sensitive information.\n*   **Data Breach:**  The vulnerability could lead to significant data breaches as former members can access sensitive information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n1.  **Obtain Organization Key:** An attacker gains membership to an organization to obtain the organization key.\n2.  **Revoke Access:** The attacker's access to the organization is revoked.\n3.  **Exploit Data Access:** The attacker leverages the lack of key rotation to still use the previously obtained key. They exploit the vulnerability where they can request and obtain the encrypted organization data, even after access revocation.\n4.  **Data Decryption:**  The attacker uses the valid, but old, organization key to decrypt and access all organization data, including new secrets created after their removal.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Initial Membership:** The attacker must have been a member of the targeted organization at some point to obtain the organization's encryption key.\n*   **Retained Key:** The attacker must retain a copy of the organization's key.\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Vaultwarden instance to exploit the unauthorized data access.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the Vaultwarden server.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The mgm security partners report provides a detailed description of the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including screenshots of HTTP requests and responses.\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in Vaultwarden version 1.32.0.\n*   The report mentions that an attacker could tamper with exchanged traffic to trick the Bitwarden client into decrypting the data.\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than the official CVE description, detailing the attack vector, impact, and steps to reproduce the vulnerability.",

While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state \"hard-coded credentials,\" the core issue of the organization key not being rotated after a member leaves implies a form of static or default credential usage. CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a related weakness because the user is able to use a key they should no longer have to gain access. The base level of abstraction for both CWE-798 and CWE-639 is suitable as it captures the root cause directly without over-specifying the type of credential or the exact mechanism of authorization bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe321,cwe259,cwe863,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lacking offboarding process** (**ROOTCAUSE**) which leads to the organization key not being rotated (**WEAKNESS**). This, in turn, allows former members to retain a valid key and decrypt data they should no longer have access to (**IMPACT**). Also, the application **fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server**, leading to unauthorized access (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lacking offboarding process** and the implications of the shared key not being rotated when a member leaves an organization. This points to a scenario where credentials, in this case, the organization key, are not managed properly after a user's access is revoked. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" highlights the \"Missing Organization Key Rotation\" as a core weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is based on the fact that the organization key remains static and unchanged even after a member leaves, effectively making it a long-lived, shared credential that is not properly managed. While it's not literally \"hard-coded\" in the traditional sense, the lack of rotation mechanism means it functions similarly. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" points to \"Insufficient Access Control,\" which aligns with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).\n\nCWE-798 is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the essence of the vulnerability: the use of a credential that should be invalidated but is not. The abstraction level (Base) is appropriate, as it is not as specific as a Variant like \"Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\" (CWE-321), but more specific than a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While relevant, it's a class-level CWE.
