  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3339 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Restaurant Management System Project V1.0\". The CVE description is a placeholder, but the content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/user_update.php` file. Malicious SQL queries can be injected directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/admin/user_update.php` file is vulnerable via the 'id' parameter (POST request).\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/admin/user_update.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The content includes example payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks.\n*   A screenshot of `sqlmap` output is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   The affected product is \"Restaurant Management System Project in PHP with Source Code\" available at <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/>.\n*   The vulnerable file is `/admin/user_update.php` in version V1.0.\n*   The software can be downloaded from <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip>.",

While other CWEs were considered, none aligned as directly with the provided evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** due to insufficient input validation of the 'id' parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to a **CWE-89 SQL Injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter, allowing malicious SQL queries to be injected.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support this, with **CWE-89** being the top combined result with a score of 1.0. The Complete CWE Specifications for **CWE-89** further confirm the match, as the description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's details. The recommendation for using prepared statements and parameter binding as a mitigation also support that **CWE-89** is the best classification.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-89** is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n##

Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
