## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in JeeWMS up to 20250504. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function CgAutoListController of the file /cgAutoListController.do?datagrid. The manipulation leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** JeeWMS
- **version:** up to 20250504
- **component:** /cgAutoListController.do?datagrid

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5384 Content (gitee.com_4fcc10a4_20250624_192619.html)

This content **IS RELATED** to a security vulnerability, though it doesn't provide the CVE description itself. It details multiple vulnerabilities found in the JeeWMS application hosted on Gitee.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root causes vary depending on the vulnerability, including:

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper input validation allowing malicious SQL code execution.
*   **Path Traversal:** Insufficient sanitization of file paths, enabling access to arbitrary files.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:**  Lack of proper access controls allowing reading of any file.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Lack of proper access controls allowing writing to any file.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Ability to write controllable JSP files to arbitrary locations, leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (in `CgAutoListController.do?datagrid` and `cgformTransController.do?transEditor` and `generateController.do?dogenerate`)
*   Path Traversal (in `cgformTemplateController.do?doAdd`)
*   Arbitrary File Read (in `cgformTemplateController.do?showPic`)
*   Arbitrary File Write (in `generateController.do?dogenerate`, `generateController.do?dogenerateOne2Many`, and `systemController/filedeal.do`)
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (in `generateController.do?dogenerate` and `generateController.do?dogenerateOne2Many`)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential system compromise.
*   **Path Traversal:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:**  Overwriting critical system files, potential system compromise.
*   **RCE:** Complete system compromise, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP requests to specific controller methods with crafted parameters.  The report lists the specific request paths for each vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated attacker (likely). The report doesn't specify authentication requirements, implying that some vulnerabilities may be exploitable without credentials.
*   Network access to the JeeWMS application.
*   Understanding of the application's functionality and vulnerable endpoints.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does *not* provide specific mitigation steps. It states that detailed vulnerability information (PoCs) have been sent to the vendor (huayi-tec.com) via email.  General mitigation strategies would include:

*   Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and path traversal.
*   Implementing proper access controls to restrict file access.
*   Secure coding practices to prevent arbitrary file write and RCE vulnerabilities.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing.

**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, listing specific vulnerable endpoints and the types of vulnerabilities present. It's a vulnerability report, not a CVE record itself.
