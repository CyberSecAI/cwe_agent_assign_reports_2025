## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. When a server is configured to only allow sharing with users that are in ones own groups, after a user was removed from a group, previously shared items were not unshared. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-52516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly remove shared items when a user is removed from a group, under the condition that the server is configured to allow sharing only within the same groups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The system does not automatically revoke shares when a user's group membership changes, violating the configured restriction of "share only with users in the same groups."
*   **Data Leakage:** Due to shares not being removed after group removal, users can potentially retain access to files that they should no longer have access to based on the configured group sharing rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users may retain access to files shared with them even after they've been removed from the group(s) that granted them access. This circumvents the intended access control policies.
*   **Confidentiality Risk:** This could lead to unintentional disclosure of data to users who should not have access to it, violating the confidentiality of the shared information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the misconfiguration of a Nextcloud server with the setting to "only allow sharing with users in the same groups," combined with group membership changes.
*   There is no need for an external attacker. This is a vulnerability that manifests when the system's user management functionality is used, specifically user removal from groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user who had been previously granted access to a file through a share and then subsequently removed from a group that provided them with shared access.
*   The attacker does not need to exploit any system vulnerabilities. This is a logic issue with how group memberships interact with sharing rules.
*   The user must have a valid account on the system, and must have been in a group with the other user that shared the files.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.0 and later, 29.0.0 and later. Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 26.0.0 and later, 27.0.0 and later, 28.0.0 and later, and 29.0.0 and later.
*   **Patched Versions:** This vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.9 and 29.0.5. Patches also exist for Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 26.0.13.9, 27.1.11.9, 28.0.9, and 29.0.5.
*   **Workarounds:** There is no known workaround aside from upgrading.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Low" in severity.
*  **CVSS Metrics**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: High
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: None
    *   Availability: None
*   **CWE:** CWE-269, which relates to improper privilege management.

The provided content gives more insight into the fixes implemented, including code changes that remove shares when a user is removed from a group, ensuring that the shares are correctly revoked.
