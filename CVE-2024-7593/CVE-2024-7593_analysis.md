## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm** (CWE-303) which leads to the bypass of the admin panel's authentication.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus of this vulnerability lies in the **incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm**. The vulnerability description explicitly states this as the root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-303 as the top candidate with a similarity score of 0.243. Given the explicit mention of the root cause and the retriever results, CWE-303 is the most appropriate and specific classification. The evidence comes directly from the "**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**" which states the rootcause as "**Incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm**".
