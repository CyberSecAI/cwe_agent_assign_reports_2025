CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, represents the impact of the vulnerability. Therefore, we have a CanPrecede relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe1427 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input used for LLM prompting (CWE-1427), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability is a **prompt injection** in the Monica AI Assistant, where an attacker can use a maliciously crafted prompt to exfiltrate sensitive chat data.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1427 (Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting). This is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference link content summary: \"**rootcause:** **prompt injection**\" and \"The root cause is a prompt injection vulnerability\". The retriever results also list CWE-1427 as the top result with a score of 1.0 and a usage of \"Allowed\".\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a secondary concern. While the vulnerability results in exposure of sensitive information, CWE-200 is a high-level impact CWE. It is listed in the retriever results, but its usage is \"Discouraged.\" The vulnerability description states: \"**impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". It's more accurate to focus on the root cause, which is the **prompt injection** itself (CWE-1427).\n\nThe selection of CWE-1427 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the weakness of **improper neutralization** of input used for LLM prompting. Other CWEs like CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) are more general and less specific to LLM prompting.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* CWE-74 is too general, and its usage is discouraged.
