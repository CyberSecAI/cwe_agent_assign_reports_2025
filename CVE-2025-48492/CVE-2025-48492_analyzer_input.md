## Analysis of CVE-2025-48492 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48492. It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in GetSimpleCMS-CE.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The “Edit Component” functionality writes raw user input into a PHP file under `admin/components/`. This file is then included when the front page is rendered, allowing arbitrary PHP code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-77:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Command Injection') - although the description points to PHP injection, the CWE listed is command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote Code Execution as the Apache/PHP user (www-data).
*   Full takeover of the application.
*   Potential for lateral movement to read sensitive files, databases, or pivot within the internal network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated user with access to Components → Edit can inject arbitrary PHP code into a component file via a crafted query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated user with access to the "Components → Edit" functionality.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Patched versions: `main`, `3.3.22+`
*   Affected versions: `3.3.16 - 3.3.21`

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to add a webshell and execute commands.
*   CVSS v4 scoring is provided: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
