Verification:**\n\nThe content from both sources relates to CVE-2025-26486. The `cvcn.gov.it` page specifically details the vulnerability, while the `acn.gov.it` page lists alerts, including references to CVEs (though not directly detailing this specific one).\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n**From `cvcn.gov.it`:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, Use of Weak Hash, Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak hashing algorithm and weak salt methodology for password storage.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could brute-force user passwords or find a collision to gain access to the target application using BETA80 \u201cLife 1st Identity Manager\u201d for authentication.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Access to the database storing hashed passwords or leaked password hashes.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the database or leaked password hashes.\n*   **CVSS v3.1:**\n    *   **Base Score:** 6.0 (Medium)\n    *   **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N\n*   **Affected Product:** Beta80 Life 1st 1.5.2.14234\n\n**From `acn.gov.it`:**\n\n*   The page lists several security alerts, but does not provide specific details about CVE-2025-26486 beyond its existence.\n\n**3. Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The `cvcn.gov.it` content provides more detail than the official CVE description (as of the time of analysis, the CVE description was a placeholder).\n*   The content is technical and preserves original descriptions.\n*   No speculation is included; the analysis is based solely on the provided text.\n*   The Italian text has been translated to English.",

CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) is a peer of CWE-916 and also a child of CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm).
