**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The BuddyBoss Platform plugin has an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The plugin allows a user to like a private post by directly manipulating the `id` parameter in the request. There is no proper access control check to verify if the user has permission to interact with the specified post.

*   The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the target post they wish to like.
