# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-58042

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rhashtable Fix potential **deadlock** by moving schedule_work outside lock Move the hash table growth check and work scheduling outside the rht lock to prevent a possible circular locking dependency. The original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to a potential **deadlock** scenario involving nested locks between rhashtable bucket, rq lock, and dsq lock. By relocating the growth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock, we break this potential **deadlock** chain. This change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing restrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler and workqueue contexts. Import to say that this calls rht_grow_above_75(), which reads from struct rhashtable without holding the lock, if this is a problem, we can move the check to the lock, and schedule the workqueue after the lock. Modified so that atomic_inc is also moved outside of the bucket lock along with the growth above 75% check.

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-833 (Deadlock). CWE-833 is a specific type of CWE-667. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "deadlock," choosing the more specific CWE-833 is more appropriate. There are no other strong relationships evident in the provided data that significantly influenced the selection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves an initial **improper locking** condition (CWE-667) leading to a **deadlock** (CWE-833). The root cause is the locking dependency that could trigger a lockdep warning. The chain is relatively short and direct.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the term "**deadlock**". The Retriever Results also list CWE-833 (Deadlock) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as high-scoring candidates. The decision to select CWE-833 as the primary CWE is based on its direct relevance to the described vulnerability and its "Base" abstraction level, which is preferred. CWE-667 is a valid, more general, categorization of the vulnerability and is included as a secondary candidate.

The evidence supporting the selection of CWE-833 is the repeated mention of "**deadlock**" in the vulnerability description: "Fix potential **deadlock**", "potential **deadlock** scenario", and "break this potential **deadlock** chain."

CWE-833 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the type of concurrency issue present in the described vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.
