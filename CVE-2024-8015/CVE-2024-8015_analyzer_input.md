## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **insecure type resolution**, specifically, the "Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')" (CWE-470). This indicates that the application uses user-provided input to determine which classes or code should be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe Reflection:** The core weakness is the use of externally controlled input in the process of resolving types. This is often done with reflection and may allow an attacker to force the application to instantiate or load arbitrary classes.
*   **Object Injection:** The vulnerability makes the application susceptible to object injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the data provided to cause the system to create malicious objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through user-provided input that influences type resolution within the Telerik Report Server. The specific method for delivering this malicious input is not detailed in this content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable type resolution mechanism within the Telerik Report Server.
*   The attacker would likely need to have access to the Telerik Report Server application.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Telerik Report Server 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.806) and earlier versions are affected.
*   **Solution:** Upgrade to version 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.924) or later.
*   **Mitigation:** As a temporary measure, changing the Report Server's Application Pool user to one with limited permissions can mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.1, indicating a critical severity.
*   **Credit:** Markus Wulftange with CODE WHITE GmbH is credited for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.
