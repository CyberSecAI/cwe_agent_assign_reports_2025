The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive information from protected posts through the WordPress core search feature.\\n\\n### Details:\\n*   **Root Cause:** The plugin failed to properly exclude protected content from WordPress search queries.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n    *   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Protected posts were not being excluded from search results, leading to the exposure of restricted information.\\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:**\\n    *   Unauthenticated attackers could gain access to sensitive content that should only be visible to users with higher-level roles (e.g., administrators).\\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\\n    *   **WordPress Core Search:** Exploiting the vulnerability through the standard WordPress search functionality.\\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.\\n\\n### Additional Information:\\n* The provided changeset also describes other changes made in version 4.5.6:\\n    * A new free addon for resetting plugin settings and data.\\n    * The \\'load_plugin_textdomain\\' function call has been moved to the \\'init\\' hook with higher priority for better compatibility with other plugins.\\n    * The language POT file has been regenerated.\\n*   The Wordfence analysis specifies the vulnerability as \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\".\\n*   The vulnerability has been addressed in version 4.5.6.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 1, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, 90:
