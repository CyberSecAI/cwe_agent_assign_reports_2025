  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i40e Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by **concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash**. The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks. To fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock), ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access. Additionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future. Reproduction steps 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting portvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the mac_filter_hash. This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.",

Multiple threads modifying the hash simultaneously leads to inconsistent state and memory leaks.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition due to lack of synchronization when accessing and modifying the `mac_filter_hash`.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leaks and inconsistent state within the `mac_filter_hash` structure, potentially leading to system instability or unexpected behavior.\n- **Attack vectors:** Triggering concurrent macvlan operations, such as adding and deleting port VLANs or MAC filters, on Virtual Functions (VFs).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to spawn VFs and configure port VLANs on them, and trigger concurrent macvlan operations. This likely requires some level of administrative or privileged access to the system or hypervisor.\n\nThe provided content gives more details than a simple CVE description by specifying the exact code locations of the issue and describing the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.",
