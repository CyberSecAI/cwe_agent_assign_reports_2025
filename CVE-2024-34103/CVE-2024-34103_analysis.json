While more specific base-level CWEs exist under CWE-287, the provided description doesn't provide enough information to pinpoint the exact authentication failure mechanism. **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)** is considered a secondary weakness because **Improper Authentication** often precedes authorization bypass. The relationship between these two is that successful exploitation of **Improper Authentication** can lead to unauthorized access, which is a form of **Incorrect Authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe287 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication (CWE-287)**, which allows an attacker to bypass identity verification.
