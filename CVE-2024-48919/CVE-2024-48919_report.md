# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-48919

## Description

Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursors Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the users terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage. A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if youre working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursors maintainers also recommend, as best practice

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-74, a Class-level CWE that encompasses injection vulnerabilities where special elements are not properly neutralized before being used by a downstream component. The more specific CWE-94, a Base-level CWE representing Code Injection, is considered as a likely secondary weakness given the potential for arbitrary code execution. CWE-79 is another related Base-level CWE because the injection happens via a webpage.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input sanitization** in Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K feature, allowing an attacker to inject malicious prompts via a compromised webpage. This leads to the language model generating arbitrary commands which are then streamed directly into the user's terminal due to **unfiltered output streaming**. The chain culminates in **arbitrary command execution** on the user's machine, enabling potential data exfiltration or system manipulation.
  - **Root Cause:** Lack of Input Sanitization
  - **Weakness 1:** CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
  - **Weakness 2:** Unfiltered output streaming
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence supporting this classification includes the prompt injection vulnerability in Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K feature, the **lack of input sanitization**, the **unfiltered output streaming**, and the potential for **arbitrary command execution**.

The primary CWE selected is CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'), because the injected prompts lead to the language model generating arbitrary commands which are then streamed directly into the user's terminal. This is the best fit to the vulnerability description.

CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to arbitrary command execution.

CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') is a secondary CWE because the injection happens via a webpage.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs: While an incomplete list of disallowed inputs could be a contributing factor, the core issue is the improper handling of special elements in the output used by a downstream component.
*   CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine: This CWE is less relevant as the vulnerability doesn't directly involve a template engine.
*   CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output: While encoding/escaping issues might be present, the primary concern is the lack of neutralization of special elements leading to injection.
