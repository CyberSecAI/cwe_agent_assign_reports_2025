  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cachefiles Set object to close if ondemand_id < 0 in copen If copen is maliciously called in the user mode, it may delete the request corresponding to the random id. And the request may have not been read yet. Note that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done with the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request corresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so the read request is never completed and blocks other process. Fix this issue by simply set object to close if its id < 0 in copen.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41074.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` function within the Linux kernel's cachefiles subsystem. If `copen` is called with a negative `ondemand_id`, it can lead to a situation where a request corresponding to a random ID is deleted before it is read.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The `copen` function could be maliciously triggered from user mode, leading to the deletion of a pending request.\n- When an object is set to reopen, the open request is performed while in the \"reopen\" state. This prevents the request from being processed correctly by `select_req`, causing a read request to never complete and blocking other processes.\n- The code did not properly handle cases where `ondemand_id` is negative, leading to incorrect object state management.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- A malicious user can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering the vulnerability. This occurs because a read request will never complete, blocking other processes that rely on the cachefiles subsystem.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A malicious user-mode application could call the `copen` function with a negative `ondemand_id`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user mode.\n- The attacker would need to be able to call `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` with a crafted negative id.\n\nThe provided patches fix this vulnerability by setting the object to a closed state if its `ondemand_id` is negative within the `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` function.",

It is related to resource management issues. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) were considered as secondary CWEs. CWE-770 could precede CWE-404. CWE-476 is a common consequence of resource management problems.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe404 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a call to `copen` with a negative `ondemand_id`. This leads to the deletion of a pending request before it is read. The object is set to reopen, but the request is skipped in `select_req`, so the read request never completes, blocking other processes.\n\nThe chain is:\n1.  Improper input (`ondemand_id < 0`) leading to ...\n2.  **Improper Resource Shutdown or Release** (CWE-404) because the request is deleted prematurely, causing a resource (read request) not to be completed. This leads to ...\n3.  Potential denial of service due to blocked processes.\n4.  Possibly **NULL Pointer Dereference** (CWE-476) or **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (CWE-770) although the description doesn't give enough detail to be certain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper resource shutdown or release** (CWE-404). The vulnerability description clearly states that a request is deleted before being read, which perfectly aligns with the concept of a resource not being properly released. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating that the code did not properly handle cases where `ondemand_id` is negative, leading to incorrect object state management, resulting in a read request never completing.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-404 as the primary CWE. While other CWEs like CWE-770 and CWE-476 are possibilities, they are not as directly supported by the description. CWE-770 might be relevant if the improper shutdown leads to resource exhaustion, but this is not explicitly stated. CWE-476 could occur if the deleted request results in a null pointer dereference, but again, this is speculative. Therefore, CWE-404 is the most appropriate primary CWE based on the available evidence.\n\n*   **CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The `copen` function's failure to properly handle negative `ondemand_id` values results in premature deletion of a pending request, which is an instance of improper resource release.\n    *   **Security Implications:** This leads to a denial-of-service condition as a read request will never complete, blocking other processes.\n    *   **Relationship Analysis:** It is a Class-level CWE, indicating a general category of resource management issues.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The usage is Allowed-with-Review, acknowledging that more specific Base-level CWEs could exist, but CWE-404 accurately captures the essence of the problem.\n    *   **Primary/Secondary:** Primary.\n*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** If the improper release contributes to resource exhaustion.\n    *   **Security Implications:** Could exacerbate DoS.\n    *   **Relationship Analysis:** Is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** Allowed.\n    *   **Primary/Secondary:** Secondary.\n*   **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** Is a possible consequence of the resource being improperly shutdown or released.\n    *   **Security Implications:** Could cause the system to crash.\n    *   **Relationship Analysis:** Is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-754.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** Allowed.\n    *   **Primary/Secondary:** Secondary.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-639, CWE-863, CWE-362, CWE-1321, CWE-125, CWE-212, CWE-923: These relate to Authorization Bypass, Incorrect Authorization, Race Conditions, Prototype Pollution, Out-of-bounds Read, Removal of Sensitive Information, and Restriction of Communication Channel.
