CWE-823 (**Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset**) could lead to CWE-787 if an incorrect offset is used to access a memory location outside the intended bounds.

The primary weakness, directly resulting from this negative indexing, is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), as the program writes data to an unintended memory location.\n\nThe Retriever results indicated CWE-787 as the top candidate. The description mentions \"memory corruption\" and \"**negative indexing**\" which aligns well with an out-of-bounds write scenario.\n\nCWE-823 (**Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset**) was also considered as a secondary candidate. The **negative indexing** could be interpreted as an out-of-range pointer offset.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly describes the **out-of-bounds write** condition resulting from the **negative indexing**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
