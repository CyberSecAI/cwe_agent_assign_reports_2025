## Vulnerability Description
xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a vulnerability that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login attempts. The number of max login attempts is supposed to be limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite number of login attempts.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** infinite number of login attempts
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** xrdp
- **version:** prior to 0.10.0
