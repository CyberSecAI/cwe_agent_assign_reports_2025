  "description": "xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a vulnerability that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login attempts. The number of max login attempts is supposed to be limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite number of login attempts.",

This CWE directly addresses the core issue described in the vulnerability, where the `MaxLoginRetry` parameter is not effectively enforced.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe307 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts** (CWE-307) due to the `MaxLoginRetry` parameter not being enforced.\nThis leads directly to the impact of allowing an infinite number of login attempts, potentially facilitating brute-force attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description states that the `MaxLoginRetry` parameter in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini` is not effectively enforced, allowing an unlimited number of login attempts. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the \"MaxLoginRetry parameter in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini` is not effectively enforced, allowing an unlimited number of login attempts.\" This aligns directly with CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts), which describes a situation where the product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-307 being among the top CWEs identified.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
