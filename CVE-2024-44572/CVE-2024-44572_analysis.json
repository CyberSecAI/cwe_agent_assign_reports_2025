Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"command injection,\" and CWE-78 is a more specific type of command injection related to OS commands, it is the preferred choice. CWE-78 being at the Base level of abstraction further supports this decision, providing more granularity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements** used in constructing an OS command (CWE-78).\n2.  **Impact:** Remote command execution due to successful injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly aligns with the concept of **command injection**, with the description explicitly stating it. The retriever results reinforce this, with CWE-77 and CWE-78 being the top candidates. The relationship analysis further clarifies the choice between CWE-77 and CWE-78. Since this is **command injection** relating to an OS command, CWE-78 is a better fit than the more general CWE-77.
