# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56086

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Logpoint before 7.5.0. Authenticated users can inject payloads in Report Templates. These are executed when the backup process is initiated, leading to Remote Code Execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Remote Code Execution and execute payloads
- **attacker:** authenticated users
- **product:** Logpoint
- **version:** before 7.5.0
- **component:** Report Templates

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to inject malicious payloads within Report Templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core issue is that the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within report templates, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.
*   Lack of input validation: The system fails to properly sanitize inputs to the report template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Logpoint. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Report Template Manipulation:** An attacker with authenticated access to the Logpoint system can create or modify Report Templates by inserting malicious code.
*   **Backup Process Trigger:** The injected code is executed when the system's backup process is initiated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Logpoint system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The advisory specifies "PR:L", indicating that even a low-privileged authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
