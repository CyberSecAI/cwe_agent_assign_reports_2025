  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0490 Content\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to a potential vulnerability. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `fladmin/article_dodel.php` file of the `native-php-cms` project on GitHub.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Failure to filter the input `id` parameter value in `fladmin/article_dodel.php`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Allows attackers to directly inject data. (The exact impact isn't detailed, but SQL injection can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion.)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `id` parameter in a request to `fladmin/article_dodel.php`.\n*   Example exploit provided: `<http://192.168.0.104/fladmin/article_dodel.php?id=extractvalue(1,concat(0x5c,user(),0x5c))>`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned, suggesting it might be exploitable without credentials.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter are required to prevent the SQL injection.\n\n**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides a concrete example of a working exploit.\n*   It specifies the exact file and parameter vulnerable to the attack.\n*   It includes a timestamp for when the issue was reported (Jan 6, 2025).\n*   It provides the affected project and repository details.",
