  "description": "Zulip server provides an open-source team chat that helps teams stay productive and focused. Zulip Server 7.0 and above are vulnerable to an information disclose attack, where, if a Zulip server is hosting multiple organizations, an unauthenticated user can make a request and determine if an email address is in use by a user. Zulip Server 9.4 resolves the issue, as does the `main` branch of Zulip Server. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

It details a vulnerability in Zulip Server versions >= 7.0, patched in version 9.4, and provides details about the root cause, impact, and mitigation.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability leaks information by returning an \"invalid subdomain\" error when an attempt is made to log in to `user@example.com` on a subdomain X when `user@example.com` does not exist on X, but *does* exist on another subdomain Y.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Information disclosure. The server reveals whether an email address is associated with an account on a different subdomain.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn unauthenticated user can determine if an email address is in use by a user within the Zulip server, even if they attempt to log in to the wrong subdomain.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based attack. An attacker can send requests over the network to determine email address existence.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Zulip Server version 9.4 or later.\n*   The `main` branch of Zulip Server also contains the fix.\n*   The fix removes the \"invalid subdomain\" error message and instead returns a generic authentication error (\"Your username or password is incorrect\").\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   6.9 (Moderate)\n\n**CVSS v4 Metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network\n*   Attack Complexity: Low\n*   Attack Requirements: None\n*   Privileges Required: None\n*   User Interaction: None\n*   Confidentiality: Low\n*   Integrity: None\n*   Availability: None\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The commit message (c6334a7) and associated code changes (in `test_auth_backends.py` and `auth.py`) are provided, demonstrating the fix and related tests.\n*   The content explicitly states that the `invalid_subdomain` error was intended for server logs only and should not be exposed to end-users.\n*   The content provides a detailed explanation of the CVSS v4 metrics.",

The Zulip server reveals whether an email address is associated with an account, even if the login attempt is made on the wrong subdomain. The **root cause** lies in the fact that the server's error response exposes this information, which it should not.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is strong, as the vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary explicitly state the information disclosure.\n\n> \"Zulip server ... are vulnerable to an information disclose attack, where, if a Zulip server is hosting multiple organizations, an unauthenticated user can make a request and determine if an email address is in use by a user.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-201 as a potentially relevant CWE. While other CWEs such as those related to authorization and authentication were also suggested, they do not directly address the core issue of sensitive information being leaked in the response.\n\nTherefore, CWE-201 is the most appropriate and specific CWE to map to this vulnerability.
