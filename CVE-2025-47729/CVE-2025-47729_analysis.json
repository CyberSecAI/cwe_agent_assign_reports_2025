CWE-312 is a more specific case of CWE-311. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) was also considered as a secondary weakness, because the reference links mentioned hardcoded credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage** of messages, which leads to the impact of exposing user data. The **hardcoded credentials** is a secondary issue that could lead to further compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **cleartext storage** of sensitive information, which directly aligns with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the TeleMessage archiving backend holds **cleartext copies** of messages. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by stating \"The TeleMessage Signal clone app archived decrypted messages without re-encrypting them for storage.\" This is a direct instance of sensitive data being stored without encryption.\n\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311, providing a more granular classification.\n\nCWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) was considered as a secondary issue because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions \"Source code for the messaging app contains hardcoded credentials among other vulnerabilities.\" This indicates a potential secondary weakness related to cryptographic key management.\n\nThe choice of CWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **cleartext storage** aspect of the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
