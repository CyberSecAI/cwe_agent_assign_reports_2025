  "description": "symfony/validator is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides tools to validate values. It is possible to trick a `Validator` configured with a regular expression using the `$` metacharacters, with an input ending with `\\n`. Symfony as of versions 5.4.43, 6.4.11, and 7.1.4 now uses the `D` regex modifier to match the entire input. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50343:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of regular expressions in Symfony's validator component. Specifically, the validators used the `$` metacharacter, which matches the end of a line, but did not account for the presence of newline characters (`\\n`) at the end of the input string. This allowed an attacker to bypass the validation if the input ended with `\\n`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Incorrect Regular Expression Usage:** The regular expressions used in several validators (CardScheme, CssColor, Date, Email, Time, Url) did not consider the possibility of a newline character at the end of the input string when using the `$` anchor.\n- **Bypass of Validation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended validation logic by appending a newline character to the input string, which could lead to invalid data being accepted.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- The impact is described as \"Low\" severity.\n- The main impact is that a user can provide invalid input that bypasses validation.\n- There is no mention of data compromise, integrity or availability impact\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is **Network** because the attacker can submit the payload over the network to the application using the validator.\n- The attack complexity is **High** because the attacker would need to know how the validation works to craft a specific string ending with `\\n`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to send input to a Symfony application that uses the vulnerable validators.\n-  The attacker has to know the validation logic to be able to craft the malicious payload.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The fix introduces the `D` regex modifier. This modifier treats the input string as a single line, allowing the `$` anchor to correctly match the end of the string even if it contains newline characters.\n- The affected versions are Symfony <5.4.43, >6, <6.4.11 and >7, <7.1.4.\n- The patched versions are 5.4.43, 6.4.11 and 7.1.4.\n- The commit fixing the issue is [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/7d1032bbead9a4229b32fa6ebca32681c80cb76f).\n- This vulnerability was reported by Offscript and the fix was provided by Alexandre Daubois.",

While CWE-1333 was a top retriever result, it represents a potential performance impact rather than the core validation issue. CWE-1286 directly addresses the **improper validation** of the input's syntax, making it a more fitting primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1286 primary\n    class cwe1333 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation** due to the incorrect regular expression usage. This leads to the bypass of validation, allowing invalid input to be accepted. The root cause is the failure to properly validate the syntactic correctness of the input, and a possible secondary weakness is inefficient regex complexity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the fact that the regular expression validator was not properly accounting for the end of line character. The description indicates that the validator did not account for a newline character, leading to the bypass. The introduction of the `D` regex modifier confirms this. While CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) was a high-ranking result from the retriever, it describes a different type of issue (performance) than the core problem, which is a validation bypass. CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) more accurately captures the root cause.

The `$` metacharacter in the regex matches the end of a line, but without the `D` modifier, it doesn't treat the entire input as a single line. This allows an attacker to bypass the validation by appending `\\n` to the input, as the regex matches up to the newline, effectively ignoring the rest of the input.\n\n*   **Security Implications:** This can lead to the acceptance of invalid data, potentially causing further issues depending on how the data is used downstream.\n*   **Potential Impact:** The impact is rated as low severity, with the primary concern being the acceptance of invalid input.\n*   **Relationships:** No direct parent-child or chain relationships are explicitly relevant here.\n*   **Primary/Secondary:** This is the primary weakness, as it directly describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n*   **Mapping Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends this CWE.\n\n**Technical Explanation for CWE-1333:**\n\nWhile Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333) could be considered, the primary issue isn't the computational complexity of the regex, but rather its incorrect logic in handling newline characters.
