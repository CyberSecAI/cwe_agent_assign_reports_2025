## Vulnerability Description
symfony/validator is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides tools to validate values. It is possible to trick a `Validator` configured with a regular expression using the `$` metacharacters, with an input ending with `\n`. Symfony as of versions 5.4.43, 6.4.11, and 7.1.4 now uses the `D` regex modifier to match the entire input. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Symfony
- **version:** 5.4.43, 6.4.11, and 7.1.4
- **component:** symfony/validator

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of regular expressions in Symfony's validator component. Specifically, the validators used the `$` metacharacter, which matches the end of a line, but did not account for the presence of newline characters (`\n`) at the end of the input string. This allowed an attacker to bypass the validation if the input ended with `\n`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Regular Expression Usage:** The regular expressions used in several validators (CardScheme, CssColor, Date, Email, Time, Url) did not consider the possibility of a newline character at the end of the input string when using the `$` anchor.
- **Bypass of Validation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended validation logic by appending a newline character to the input string, which could lead to invalid data being accepted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "Low" severity.
- The main impact is that a user can provide invalid input that bypasses validation.
- There is no mention of data compromise, integrity or availability impact

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network** because the attacker can submit the payload over the network to the application using the validator.
- The attack complexity is **High** because the attacker would need to know how the validation works to craft a specific string ending with `\n`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send input to a Symfony application that uses the vulnerable validators.
-  The attacker has to know the validation logic to be able to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces the `D` regex modifier. This modifier treats the input string as a single line, allowing the `$` anchor to correctly match the end of the string even if it contains newline characters.
- The affected versions are Symfony <5.4.43, >6, <6.4.11 and >7, <7.1.4.
- The patched versions are 5.4.43, 6.4.11 and 7.1.4.
- The commit fixing the issue is [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/7d1032bbead9a4229b32fa6ebca32681c80cb76f).
- This vulnerability was reported by Offscript and the fix was provided by Alexandre Daubois.
