# Vulnerability Description

    SAP ERP BW Business Content is vulnerable to OS Command Injection through certain function modules. These function modules, when executed with elevated privileges, improperly handle user input, allowing attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands. This vulnerability allows the execution of unintended commands on the underlying system, posing a significant security risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the application.
