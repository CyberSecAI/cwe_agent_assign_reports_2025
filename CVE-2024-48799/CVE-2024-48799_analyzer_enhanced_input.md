## Vulnerability Description
An issue in LOREX TECHNOLOGY INC com.lorexcorp.lorexping 1.4.22 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmware update process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** LOREX TECHNOLOGY INC com.lorexcorp.lorexping
- **version:** 1.4.22
- **component:** firmware update process

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access control on the firmware server used by the `com.lorexcorp.lorexping` application during firmware updates. The server directly exposes firmware files and information, with no authentication or authorization mechanism to restrict access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of access control mechanisms on the firmware server. This allows anyone with knowledge of the URL to download firmware files.
- **Firmware Leakage:** The server's lack of access control leads to firmware leakage. This allows unauthorized access to potentially sensitive firmware files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Firmware Download:** Attackers can download the latest firmware before its official release.
- **Firmware Analysis:** Downloaded firmware can be analyzed to discover vulnerabilities or proprietary information.
- **Malicious Firmware Creation:** Attackers can create modified firmware images containing malicious code.
- **Compromised Firmware Distribution:** Attackers can distribute compromised firmware to unsuspecting users, potentially leading to device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with network access to the firmware server.
- **URL Knowledge:** An attacker needs to discover the firmware server URL and the structure of the request, which was obtained by reverse engineering the application in this instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the firmware files.
-   **Reverse Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to reverse engineer the `com.lorexcorp.lorexping` application to determine the required URL and request structure.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Knowledge of HTTP requests/responses is required to make the necessary calls

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text includes a detailed reproduction step by step including the raw http request and response, screenshots of the process as well as remediation and impact description.
- The vendor is Lorex Technology Inc. and the vulnerable app is `com.lorexcorp.lorexping`. The version is 1.4.22.
- The vulnerability was discovered by reverse engineering the app and dynamically testing the firmware download mechanism.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity due to the potential impact of firmware compromise.
