## Vulnerability Description
The MDTF Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the key attribute of the mdf_value shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
