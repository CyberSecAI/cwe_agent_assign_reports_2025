  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ethernet ti am65-cpsw Fix NAPI registration sequence Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference. This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the reception of traffic from the wire.",
