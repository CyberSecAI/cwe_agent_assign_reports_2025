# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-22006
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ethernet ti am65-cpsw Fix NAPI registration sequence Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference. This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the reception of traffic from the wire.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'Registering the interrupts for TX', 'RX DMA Channels prior to registering their respective NAPI callbacks'
- **weakness**: 'NULL pointer dereference'
