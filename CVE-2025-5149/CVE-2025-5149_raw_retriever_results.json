  "query": "A vulnerability was found in WCMS up to 8.3.11. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getMemberByUid of the file /index.php?articleadmin/getallcon of the component Login. The manipulation of the argument uid leads to improper authentication. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
