## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Vypor Attack API System v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the user GET parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** user GET parameter
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Vypor Attack API System
- **version:** v.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `user` GET parameter in Vypor's Attack API. This allows an attacker to inject shell commands into the parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the API.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The API fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input in the `user` GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any command on the server with the same privileges as the web application (e.g., `www-data` user).
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain complete control of the affected system. This can lead to data breaches, malware installation, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the API endpoint. The malicious payload is embedded within the `user` parameter of the URL.
*   **Example URL:** `[http://HOST/Vypors-Attack-API-System/api.php?method=stop&user=foo%22;whoami;%22](http://192.53.123.89/Vypors-Attack-API-System/api.php?method=stop&user=blah%22%3Bwhoami%3B%22)`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to construct HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable API.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the information available, it does not appear that authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, Vypor, has not responded to reports of the vulnerability and has not provided patches or fixes.
*   The vulnerable code is part of a legacy application.
*   The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to use the `whoami` command to confirm the ability to execute code.
