# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved security/keys fix **slab-out-of-bounds** in key_task_permission KASAN reports an out of bounds read BUG KASAN **slab-out-of-bounds** in __kuid_val include/linux/uidgid.h36 BUG KASAN **slab-out-of-bounds** in uid_eq include/linux/uidgid.h63 [inline] BUG KASAN **slab-out-of-bounds** in key_task_permission+0x394/0x410 security/keys/permission.c54 Read of size 4 at addr ffff88813c3ab618 by task stress-ng/4362 CPU 2 PID 4362 Comm stress-ng Not tainted 5.10.0-14930-gafbffd6c3ede #15 Call Trace __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c82 [inline] dump_stack+0x107/0x167 lib/dump_stack.c123 print_address_description.constprop.0+0x19/0x170 mm/kasan/report.c400 __kasan_report.cold+0x6c/0x84 mm/kasan/report.c560 kasan_report+0x3a/0x50 mm/kasan/report.c585 __kuid_val include/linux/uidgid.h36 [inline] uid_eq include/linux/uidgid.h63 [inline] key_task_permission+0x394/0x410 security/keys/permission.c54 search_nested_keyrings+0x90e/0xe90 security/keys/keyring.c793 This issue was also reported by syzbot. It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]) 1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the pattern 0xxxxxxxe6. 2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1. The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened 1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root, and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a keyring. 2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function. However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK. 3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points to a shortcut. NODE A +------>+---+ ROOT | | 0 | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxxx | 0 | shortcut xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxe6 | | | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ | 6 |---+ xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 | f | xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 | f | +---+ 4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut, **it may be mistakenly transferred to a key***, **leading to a read **out-of-bounds read**.** To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.
