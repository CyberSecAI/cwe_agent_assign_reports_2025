It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]) 1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the pattern 0xxxxxxxe6. 2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1. The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened 1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root, and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a keyring. 2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function. However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK. 3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points to a shortcut. NODE A +------>+---+ ROOT | | 0 | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxxx | 0 | shortcut xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxe6 | | | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ | 6 |---+ xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 | f | xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 | f | +---+ 4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut, **it may be mistakenly transferred to a key***, **leading to a read **out-of-bounds read**.** To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of shortcut pointers within the keyring's nested search function (`search_nested_keyrings`). Specifically, when iterating through slots in a node of the keyring tree, a shortcut pointer located in the root node could be misidentified as a keyring.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Incorrect Pointer Type Identification**: The `keyring_ptr_is_keyring` function incorrectly identifies shortcut pointers as keyrings due to the shared subtype value (`KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE` and `ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK` both being `0x2UL`).\n- **Missing Shortcut Check:** The code within `search_nested_keyrings` had a conditional check `if (assoc_array_ptr_is_meta(ptr) && node->back_pointer)` which would only consider meta pointers from a root node. It did not account for shortcut pointers from a root node.\n- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** When a shortcut pointer is mistakenly treated as a key pointer, the code attempts to dereference it as such, which causes a slab out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Kernel Crash:** The out-of-bounds read triggers a Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) report, ultimately leading to a kernel crash.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The crash can result in a system-wide denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Keyring Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by adding a specific number of keys with similar hash values to the keyring.\n- **Specific Hash Pattern:** The hash values of the added keys need to have a specific pattern (`0xxxxxxxe6`) to cause the shortcut to be created in the root node.\n- **Multiple Keys:** More than 32 keys with similar hashes are required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local or Remote User:**  An attacker needs the ability to add keys to the keyring. This could be a local user or a remote user with the necessary privileges.\n- **Knowledge of Keyring Structure:** Some understanding of the keyring's internal structure and how keys are stored/hashed might be necessary to craft the specific inputs needed to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Ability to add keys to the keyring:** An attacker must be able to add multiple keys to the system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The issue was reported by syzbot, a Linux kernel fuzzer.\n- The fix involves ensuring that shortcut pointers are always treated as such and handled correctly by the `search_nested_keyrings` function by adding the condition `assoc_array_ptr_is_shortcut(ptr)` to the conditional jump to `descend_to_node`\n- The provided patches modify `security/keys/keyring.c` to include this check.",
