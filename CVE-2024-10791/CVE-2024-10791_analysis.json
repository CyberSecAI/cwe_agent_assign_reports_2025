  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Codezips Hospital Appointment System 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /doctorAction.php. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory mentions contradicting file and parameter names to be affected.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10791.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `docterAction.php` file. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input from the \"Username\" parameter. This parameter is directly used in SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the \"Username\" parameter.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized database access\n- Sensitive data leakage\n- Data tampering\n- Comprehensive system control\n- Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `docterAction.php` file with a malicious payload in the \"Username\" parameter. The \"branch\" parameter is also present in the requests, but it does not seem to be related to the vulnerability itself.\n-  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.\n- The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or authorization.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The issue was discovered during a security review of the \"Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code.\"\n- The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.\n- The provided payload examples demonstrate how to exploit these different injection techniques.\n- SQLMap was used to verify the vulnerability.\n- Suggested repairs include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.",
