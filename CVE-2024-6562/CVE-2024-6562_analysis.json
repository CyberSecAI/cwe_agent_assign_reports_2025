  "description": "The affiliate-toolkit - WordPress Affiliate Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.5. This is due **display_errors being set to true** . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

This causes the full path of the web application to be revealed in error messages.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Full Path Disclosure.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can discover the full path of the web application. This information is not useful on its own, but it can be used to aid other attacks by providing details about the system's configuration and potentially exposing sensitive directory paths.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.\n- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.\n- The attack can be carried out over the network.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.",

CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-201 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200. CWE-200 is a more general case of information exposure. CWE-201 is about specifically inserting sensitive information into sent data. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that sensitive information (the full path) is being exposed, but it doesn't specify that it is being \"inserted\" into \"sent data\". Because the description fits the broader definition of CWE-200 more accurately, it was selected as the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **misconfiguration of the `display_errors` setting** which is the **root cause**. This leads to the **exposure of the full path** of the application, which is the **sensitive information**. An unauthenticated attacker can then leverage this information to potentially aid in other attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **`display_errors` setting being set to true** is the root cause, leading to Full Path Disclosure.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the fact that it represents a broad class of vulnerabilities related to the exposure of sensitive information. While several other CWEs were considered, they were either too specific or did not accurately capture the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-200 is well-supported by the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the relationships between the CWEs. The confidence level is high due to the clear and direct connection between the misconfiguration and the resulting information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
