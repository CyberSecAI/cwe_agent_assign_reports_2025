## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2660 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-2660. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter in `/admin/index.php`.  The parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin/index.php` file is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The 'e' parameter is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to `/admin/index.php` with a malicious payload in the 'e' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
---
Parameter: e (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: e=123456' AND (SELECT 3912 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qHBy) AND 'tbBp'='tbBp&p=123456&save=Login
---
```
