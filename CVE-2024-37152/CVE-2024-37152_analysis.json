  "description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the sensitive settings exposed by /api/v1/settings endpoint without authentication. All sensitive settings are hidden except passwordPattern. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.11.3, 2.10.12, and 2.9.17.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37152:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe `/api/v1/settings` endpoint in Argo CD was accessible without any authentication. While most sensitive settings were hidden, the `passwordPattern` setting was exposed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory):** This is a general weakness related to path handling, and it's not directly the main issue here.\n- **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication):** The primary vulnerability, as the endpoint was accessible without authentication.\n- **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function):**  This is a specific case of CWE-287 and applies directly because the settings endpoint, which contains sensitive data, lacked authentication requirements.\n- **CWE-384 (Session Fixation):** While not the primary issue, this CWE is often associated with authentication problems, so is likely a related issue.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker could access the `passwordPattern` setting without authentication. This setting could potentially reveal information about password requirements, which could be used in further attacks.\n- **Potential Risks:** Exposure of configuration data, including deployment and security settings.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any prior authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint.\n- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any interaction from legitimate users.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"Moderate\" with a CVSS score of 5.3.\n- Patched versions are: 2.11.3, 2.10.12, and 2.9.17.\n- The vulnerability was reported by moshikoHassan.\n\nThe provided information gives a clear picture of the vulnerability, its causes, impacts, and how to fix it, and it also provides the CVE ID.",

The analysis favors the more specific **CWE-306** because the vulnerability description explicitly states that authentication is missing for the affected endpoint. **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)** could be considered as a secondary weakness as it represents the actual exposure of the `passwordPattern` setting, but it is less direct than the authentication issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**, as the root cause. Because there is **Missing Authentication** for the /api/v1/settings endpoint an attacker can access it. This leads to **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**, representing the exposure of the `passwordPattern` setting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that the primary vulnerability is **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**. This is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description that the `/api/v1/settings` endpoint is accessible without authentication. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this, clearly identifying **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)** and **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** as key weaknesses.\n\nThe classification guidance reinforces this decision, highlighting that **CWE-306** is appropriate when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality. The exposure of the `passwordPattern` setting can be considered a secondary issue, possibly represented by **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**, but the lack of authentication is the fundamental root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-306** is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the missing authentication for a critical function. **CWE-201** is also a Base-level CWE, representing the subsequent exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
