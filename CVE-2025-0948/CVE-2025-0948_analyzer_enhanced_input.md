## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0948 Content

This content is **RELATED** to a vulnerability in the "Itsourcecode Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" v1.0. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A GET type SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the direct use of parameters ("id", "expid", "incid", "typeid", "staffid") in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   GET type SQL injection.
*   Insufficient user input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   System control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP GET requests to vulnerable files (deldoc.php, customerview.php, typedelete.php, templatedelete.php, expview.php, incview.php, partview.php, staffview.php) with malicious payloads in the "id", "expid", "incid", "typeid", or "staffid" parameters.
*   Time-based blind SQL injection technique.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to craft malicious HTTP GET requests.
*   Network access to the vulnerable application.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

The content provides example payloads for time-based blind SQL injection targeting each vulnerable parameter:

*   `id=1' AND (SELECT 8695 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))MgIe) AND 'kaZT'='kaZT`
*   `expid=1' AND (SELECT 3590 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))alqt) AND 'NnDu'='NnDu`
*   `incid=1' AND (SELECT 1197 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))WCAk) AND 'zWDb'='zWDb`
*   `typeid=1' AND (SELECT 7717 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))RUpZ) AND 'XYNO'='XYNO`
*   `staffid=1' AND (SELECT 3951 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Asyc) AND 'eqma'='eqma`

**Additional Information:**

*   The report includes `sqlmap` commands used for testing and demonstrating the vulnerability.
