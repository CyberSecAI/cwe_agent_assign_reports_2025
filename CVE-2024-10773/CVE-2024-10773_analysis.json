While the description mentions hardcoded credentials, it doesn't specify whether they are passwords or cryptographic keys, making the base CWE-798 the most appropriate choice. CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality) is a Class-level CWE that describes the presence of undocumented functionality. The report suggests that the vulnerability involves **hardcoded credentials** for hidden user levels, so CWE-912 applies.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe912 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hardcoded credentials** (CWE-798) for hidden user levels (CWE-912). This allows for a **pass-the-hash attack**, leading to an attacker gaining full access to the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states the existence of **hardcoded credentials** for hidden user levels. The selection of CWE-798 is further supported by its high relevance score in the Retriever Results. The description does not specify the type of hardcoded credential (password or key), so the more general CWE-798 is chosen. CWE-912 is included as the **hardcoded credentials** belong to **hidden functionality**, which also led to the vulnerability.\nThe final selection balances specificity and accuracy, ensuring that the chosen CWEs accurately represent the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
