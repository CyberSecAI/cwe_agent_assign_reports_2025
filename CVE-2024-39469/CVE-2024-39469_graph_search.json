In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop with I/O if i_size of the directorys inode is also corrupted, causing the log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot. Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.
