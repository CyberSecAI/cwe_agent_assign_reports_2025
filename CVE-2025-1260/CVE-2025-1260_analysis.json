While more specific Base or Variant CWEs are preferred, the lack of detailed information about the authorization **failure** limits the ability to select a more specific CWE. CWE-863 is related to other authorization CWEs through hierarchical relationships, but none are a more precise fit based on the available evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe696[\"CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\"]\n\n    cwe696\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe696 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a missing or **incorrect** authorization check, leading to the execution of a gNOI request that should have been rejected. This results in **unexpected configuration/operations being applied** to the switch. The root cause is the **incorrect authorization**, and the impact is the application of unintended configurations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided information, which is limited. The key phrase from the vulnerability description indicates that a gNOI request is being run when it should have been rejected, suggesting an authorization issue.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a candidate. While it's a Class-level CWE, the lack of further details prevents selecting a more specific Base or Variant. CWE-696 (Incorrect Behavior Order) was also considered.\n\nThe final decision is to map to CWE-863 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that a request is being run when it should have been rejected, indicating a **failure** in authorization. CWE-696 is added as a secondary CWE, because it helps explain the consequence of applying the unintended configuration/operations.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
