It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a broken authentication vulnerability in the WeGIA application.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of old password verification when changing a user's password.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Broken Authentication\n*   Missing old password verification\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to reset the password of any user, including administrator accounts. This allows unauthorized access and control of the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based attack via POST request to `/WeGIA/controle/control.php`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Low privileges - the attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.6.  Updating to this version or later resolves the issue.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `POST /WeGIA/controle/control.php`\n*   **HTTP Request Example:**\n\n```\nPOST /WeGIA/controle/control.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: comfirewall.wegia.org:8000\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 149\n\nsenha_antiga=A&nova_senha=wegia&confirmar_senha=wegia&nomeClasse=FuncionarioControle&metodo=alterarSenha&redir=logout.php&id_pessoa=1&alterar=Alterar\n```\n\n*   **PoC:** The advisory provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to change the admin user's password by providing a random value in the `senha_antiga` field.\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-30361\n*   **CVSS Score:** 9.3 (Critical) - CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The advisory includes a detailed CVSS v4 analysis, breaking down the exploitability and impact metrics.\n*   It provides specific examples of HTTP requests used in the attack.\n*   It credits the reporter of the vulnerability (@nmmorette).\n*   It specifies the affected package (composer) and versions.",

CWE-306 was considered because the **missing** old password check effectively bypasses authentication for the password change functionality. However, since the primary issue is specifically related to the password change process, CWE-620 is the more accurate and specific classification. Both CWE-620 and CWE-306 are related to broader authentication and authorization issues, but CWE-620 focuses on the specific weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** old password verification, leading to the ability to change a user's password without proper authentication. This results in an attacker being able to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms and gain unauthorized access, including resetting admin accounts.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing** old password verification in the password change process (CWE-620).\nImpact: Authentication bypass and unauthorized access (potentially CWE-306, but more a consequence of CWE-620).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **lack of old password verification** as the primary weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-620. The CVE content summary confirms this, stating \"The vulnerability stems from the **lack of old password verification** when changing a user's password.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-620 as a top candidate.\n\nCWE-306 was considered because the **missing** password verification step allows an attacker to perform a critical function (changing a password) without proper authentication. However, since the issue is specifically about changing a password, CWE-620 is the more precise classification. The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization notes that \"CWE-306: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* \u2013 used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).\" While this is applicable, the core issue is how the password change is implemented.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-620 directly addresses the **lack of old password verification**, and while CWE-306 is relevant, it describes the broader impact of the vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links supports this decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
