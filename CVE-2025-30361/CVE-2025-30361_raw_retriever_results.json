A security vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.2.6, where it is possible to change a users password without verifying the old password. This issue exists in the control.php endpoint and allows unauthorized attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to reset the password of any user, including admin accounts. Version 3.2.6 fixes the issue.",
