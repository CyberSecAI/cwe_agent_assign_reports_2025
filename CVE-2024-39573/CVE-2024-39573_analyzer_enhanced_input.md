## Vulnerability Description
Potential **SSRF** in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to cause **unsafe RewriteRules** to unexpectedly setup URLs to be handled by mod_proxy. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unsafe RewriteRules**
- **weakness:** **SSRF**
- **impact:** setup URLs to be handled by mod_proxy
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Apache HTTP Server
- **version:** 2.4.59 and earlier
- **component:** mod_rewrite

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-39573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `mod_rewrite` module of the Apache HTTP Server.
- It stems from a potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue where unsafe `RewriteRule` configurations can lead to unexpected handling of URLs by `mod_proxy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to induce the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unexpected Proxy Handling:** Attackers can manipulate `RewriteRule`s to force the server to handle specific URLs using `mod_proxy`, potentially leading to unintended proxying of requests.
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to access internal resources or services that are not intended to be exposed to the public internet.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Rewrite Rules:** An attacker would need to inject or manipulate `RewriteRule` configurations within the Apache server configuration. This can occur by an attacker having direct access to the server's configuration files or through other means of configuration manipulation (e.g., through vulnerable web applications).
-   **Crafted Requests:** The attacker crafts requests that, when processed by `mod_rewrite`, result in the server making the proxied request to an attacker-controlled or unintended target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Configuration Access:** An attacker needs some way to influence or control the server's `mod_rewrite` configuration. This could be through direct access to configuration files, by compromising an administrator's account, or possibly through other vulnerabilities that allow manipulation of configuration settings.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected Apache server.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The issue affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.59.
-   The fix was implemented in version 2.4.60.
-   The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Orange Tsai (@orange_8361) from DEVCORE.
