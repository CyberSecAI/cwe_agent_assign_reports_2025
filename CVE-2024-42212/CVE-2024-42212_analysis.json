CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), is a compound CWE that represents the potential impact of this missing attribute. CWE-1275 can precede CWE-352 in a vulnerability chain, as the **improper, missing SameSite attribute** makes CSRF attacks easier to execute.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe1275 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1275 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper, missing SameSite attribute** (CWE-1275). This allows an attacker to potentially trick a user's browser into making unintended requests, leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks (CWE-352).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the **rootcause** is the **improper, missing SameSite attribute**. The description also mentions that this can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The retriever results also list CWE-1275 and CWE-352 as the top candidates.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrase says:\n- **rootcause:** **improper, missing SameSite attribute**\n- **weakness:** **cross-site request forgery**\n\nCWE-1275 accurately captures the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-352 represents the potential impact. The relationships between these CWEs, as indicated in the Complete CWE Specifications, further support this mapping.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1275 is a Variant that precisely identifies the **improper, missing SameSite attribute**, while CWE-352 is a Compound that accurately describes the resulting CSRF vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE
