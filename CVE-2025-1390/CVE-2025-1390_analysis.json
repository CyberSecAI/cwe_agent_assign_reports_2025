  "description": "The PAM module pam_cap.so of libcap configuration supports group names starting with @, during actual parsing, configurations not starting with @ are incorrectly recognized as group names. This may result in nonintended users being granted an inherited capability set, potentially leading to security risks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve local privilege escalation on systems where /etc/security/capability.conf is used to configure user inherited privileges by constructing specific usernames.",

While CWE-269 and CWE-863 were considered, CWE-266 was chosen as the most specific base-level CWE that directly addresses the **incorrect privilege assignment** due to the configuration parsing error. The chain relationship isn't prominent in this case, it can be thought of as **incorrect configuration** leading to **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe269 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a configuration parsing error and culminates in privilege escalation.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect parsing of group names** in the `pam_cap.so` module.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Incorrect privilege assignment** due to misinterpretation of configuration.\n3.  **Impact:** **Privilege escalation**, where unintended users gain inherited capabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The key evidence from the vulnerability description includes: \"**incorrectly recognizing configurations not starting with @ as group names**\" and \"**nonintended users being granted an inherited capability set, potentially leading to security risks**\". The analysis of CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is a configuration parsing error.\n\nBased on the provided information, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it directly describes the **incorrect assignment of privileges** to users due to the parsing error. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is also relevant, it is a more general class of weakness. CWE-266 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for privileges vs. permissions further supports this selection, emphasizing that **incorrect privilege assignment** should be mapped to CWE-266. The retriever results listed CWE-266, CWE-863, and CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) which were considered. CWE-267 was not selected as the privileges themselves are not unsafe, it is just the incorrect assignment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product **incorrectly assigns a privilege** to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1808.74\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
