  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Intelbras InControl up to 2.21.57. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /v1/operador/ of the component Relatorio de Operadores Page. The manipulation of the argument fields leads to code injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was informed early on 2024-07-19 about this issue. The release of a fixed version 2.21.58 was announced for the end of August 2024 but then was postponed until 2024-09-20.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9324:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `fields` parameter of the API calls related to report generation, specifically in the `/v1/operador/relatorio` and `/v1/evento_operador/relatorio` endpoints. This allows for the injection of arbitrary Python code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Python code injection flaw. The application uses the `eval` and `compile` functions on the unsanitized `fields` parameter, enabling the execution of arbitrary python code provided by the attacker.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full Server Control:** The attacker can achieve full control of the server by executing arbitrary operating system commands via the injected code.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to execute arbitrary Python code allows for RCE, enabling the attacker to potentially install malware, steal data, or disrupt operations.\n*   **Data Exfiltration**: An attacker can exfiltrate data through network requests.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.\n*   **Modified `fields` parameter:**  The malicious code is injected into the `fields` parameter of the HTTP request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Intelbras InControl server.\n*   **Authentication (potentially):** While the provided text mentions default credentials (`admin/admin`), which indicates an issue on the product setup, it is not clear whether a successful authentication is required.\n*   **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable API endpoints.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** Intelbras InControl versions 2.21.56 and 2.21.57 are vulnerable.\n*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.21.58.\n*   **Exploitability:** The vulnerability is easily exploitable using tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request.\n*  **Severity**: Intelbras rates this vulnerability as medium risk.\n* **Affected Product**: InControl Web\n\nThe content provides more details than a simple CVE description, such as the specific API endpoints, vulnerable parameters, and example payloads. It also provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) and a video demonstration.",

CWE-94 is a child of CWE-74. The vulnerability involves the injection of code, specifically Python code, and CWE-94 directly addresses the improper control of code generation, making it a more specific and appropriate choice than the broader CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper input validation, leading to code injection, and ultimately resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n  - Improper Input Validation (Implicit) -> **CWE-94** -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE description and summary clearly indicate that the vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code. The key evidence is the use of `eval` and `compile` functions on unsanitized input, allowing for Python code injection.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-79, CWE-89, and CWE-74. However, these CWEs are either too broad or focus on specific injection types (e.g., SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting). CWE-94, \"Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\", aligns most directly with the vulnerability, as it describes the core issue of injecting and executing arbitrary code. The relationship analysis further supports this choice, as CWE-94 is a more specific child of the broader CWE-74.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence of code injection, the specificity of CWE-94, and the relationship analysis that positions CWE-94 as a more precise classification than its parent, CWE-74.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.14\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-98\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-96\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-95\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1336\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-913\n\n**CWE-94**: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The Intelbras InControl software **fails to properly sanitize input** used in the `fields` parameter of the API calls, specifically in `/v1/operador/relatorio` and `/v1/evento_operador/relatorio` endpoints. This **allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Python code** that is then executed by the `eval` and `compile` functions.

While CWE-74 is a broader category, CWE-94 specifically addresses the injection and execution of code, making it a more precise classification for this vulnerability.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The mapping guidance for CWE-94 indicates \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it can be misused for vulnerabilities where code execution is the impact rather than the root cause.
