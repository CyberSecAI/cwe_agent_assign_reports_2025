  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Intelbras InControl up to 2.21.57. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /v1/operador/ of the component Relatorio de Operadores Page. The manipulation of the argument fields leads to code injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was informed early on 2024-07-19 about this issue. The release of a fixed version 2.21.58 was announced for the end of August 2024 but then was postponed until 2024-09-20.",
