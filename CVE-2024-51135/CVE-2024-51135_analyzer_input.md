# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-51135

## Vulnerability Description
An **XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability in the component DocumentBuilderFactory of powertac-server v1.9.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code via supplying a crafted request containing malicious XML entities.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **XML External Entity (XXE)**
- **impact:** access sensitive information and execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** crafted request containing malicious XML entities
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** powertac-server
- **version:** v1.9.0
- **component:** DocumentBuilderFactory

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure processing of XML data in the `BootstrapDataRepo.java` within the Power TAC server application. Specifically, the `DocumentBuilderFactory` instance used to parse XML files does not enable security settings or disable external entities loading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XML External Entity injection. This is due to the lack of proper configuration on the `DocumentBuilderFactory` instance when parsing XML files. The application does not disable external entity resolution, allowing an attacker to include malicious external entities in the XML data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
- **Information Leak:** An attacker can potentially access local files or resources on the server.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service by making the server perform a large number of external requests or access large local files.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a malicious XML file or a URL pointing to a malicious XML file. This malicious XML file includes a doctype declaration with an external entity that, when processed, will cause the application to perform the request to a resource defined by the attacker.
- The vulnerable code is within the `readBootRecord` function of the `BootstrapDataRepo.java` class.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the path of a malicious XML file to the `readBootRecord` method, either directly or through a URL.
- The attacker needs to have control over the content of the provided XML file.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerable component is the `server-interface` module with versions <= 1.9.0 of the powertac-server.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The recommended remediation steps include setting the `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature to `true` on the `DocumentBuilderFactory` instance, or disabling external entity resolution using the specific `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl` feature, and disabling external entities resolution with `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` and `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities`.
