# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-5343

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5343

## Description

The Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.19. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rbs_ajax_create_article and rbs_ajax_reset_views functions**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rbs_ajax_create_article and rbs_ajax_reset_views functions
- **Weakness:** cross-site request forgery
- **Impact:** create new posts and reset gallery view counts
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Rbs Image Gallery plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 3.2.19
- **Component:** Photo Gallery, Images, Slider

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states "Cross-Site Request Forgery" and the root cause is **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.75 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves a **missing nonce validation** which is a form of authorization. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery. CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a related weakness as **missing nonce validation** directly leads to **missing authorization**. CWE-352 is a compound weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing or incorrect nonce validation** (CWE-352), which allows unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts.
*   Root Cause: CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**.
*   Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can create new posts and reset gallery view counts.

## Summary of Analysis

The vulnerability is clearly a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. The description explicitly mentions "Cross-Site Request Forgery" and the root cause. The primary CWE is CWE-352.

CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **missing nonce validation** is a form of authorization.

The retriever results also listed CWE-862 and CWE-352 with high scores, supporting the selection of these CWEs.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-352 directly addresses the vulnerability and CWE-862 provides additional context about the authorization mechanism.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
