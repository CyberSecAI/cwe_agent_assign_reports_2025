This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rbs_ajax_create_article and rbs_ajax_reset_views functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
