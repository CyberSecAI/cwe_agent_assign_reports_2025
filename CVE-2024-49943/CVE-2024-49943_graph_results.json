  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/guc_submit add missing locking in wedged_fini Any non-wedged queue can have a zero refcount here and can be running concurrently with an async queue destroy, therefore dereferencing the queue ptr to check wedge status after the lookup can trigger UAF if queue is not wedged. Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock held around the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, before dropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.
