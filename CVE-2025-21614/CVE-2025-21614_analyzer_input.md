# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21614

## Vulnerability Description
go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers **resource exhaustion** in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **resource exhaustion**
- **impact:** denial of service attacks
- **vector:** specially crafted responses from a Git server
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** go-git
- **version:** prior to v5.13

## CVE-2025-21614 Analysis

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-21614. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Maliciously crafted responses from a Git server trigger resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* Denial of Service (DoS)
* CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can perform denial of service attacks, causing resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients.

**Attack vectors:**

* Network: Attacker sends specially crafted responses from a Git server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

* No privileges required.
* No user interaction required.
* Attacker needs to be able to control or intercept responses from a Git server.

**Mitigation or fix:**

* Upgrade to `go-git` version 5.13.0 or later.
* Limit use of `go-git` to trustworthy Git servers if upgrading is not possible.

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 / 10 (High)
