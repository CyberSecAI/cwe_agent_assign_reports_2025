# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-46329

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - The **vulnerability** involves the **insertion of a client-side encryption master key into a log file** when the logging level is set to DEBUG. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-532. Although CWE-532 has a parent CWE, CWE-200, which describes security sensitive information, the additional detail of logging makes CWE-532 a more appropriate and specific choice. There are also child CWEs such as CWE-538, but the description doesn't specify that the log file is externally accessible, so CWE-532 is the best fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file**.

1.  **Root Cause:** The **logging mechanism** within libsnowflakeclient, when set to DEBUG, inadvertently includes the client-side encryption master key.
2.  **Weakness:** **Insertion of sensitive information** (encryption key) into the log file.
3.  **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to the encryption key if the log file is compromised, though the key alone is insufficient to access sensitive data without additional authorizations.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the explicit action of logging sensitive data, specifically the client-side encryption master key, when the logging level is set to DEBUG. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description clearly states that "the Connector would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage." The most appropriate CWE is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), which directly aligns with this behavior. The retriever results also highly suggest CWE-532. The graph relationships support using CWE-532 as it is more specific than its parent.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

**Not Used:** The data *is* encrypted, the problem is the logging of the encryption key.

## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes sensitive information to a log file.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**USED:** This is the primary CWE.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The problem is not about improper removal before storage or transfer, but rather the **insertion into a log file**.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The vulnerability is not related to authentication algorithms.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The sensitive data is not transmitted, but rather logged.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The description does not indicate that the log file is externally accessible.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** While related, the specificity of logging makes CWE-532 a better fit.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Not Used:** The vulnerability is not related to weak credentials.
