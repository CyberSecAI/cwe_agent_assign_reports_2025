This makes the encryption predictable.\n- **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values):** This is the identified CWE, highlighting the flaw in generating the encryption IV.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The use of a static IV compromises the confidentiality of the encrypted data. Attackers can potentially infer information about the plaintext by observing patterns in the ciphertext.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when an event is saved in the SQLite events table and encrypts the \"email\" element in the meta map.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Remote access to the system where netbird is used.\n- Ability to trigger the saving of an event that includes the email meta-data.",

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",
