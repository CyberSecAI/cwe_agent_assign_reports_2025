# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41260

## Vulnerability Description
A **static initialization vector** (IV) in the encrypt function of netbird v0.28.4 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **static initialization vector**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** netbird
- **version:** v0.28.4
- **component:** encrypt function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41260.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a static Initialization Vector (IV) in the `Encrypt` function of the `netbird` software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Static IV:** The encryption process uses a hardcoded, static IV instead of a randomly generated one. This makes the encryption predictable.
- **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values):** This is the identified CWE, highlighting the flaw in generating the encryption IV.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The use of a static IV compromises the confidentiality of the encrypted data. Attackers can potentially infer information about the plaintext by observing patterns in the ciphertext.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an event is saved in the SQLite events table and encrypts the "email" element in the meta map.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the system where netbird is used.
- Ability to trigger the saving of an event that includes the email meta-data.
