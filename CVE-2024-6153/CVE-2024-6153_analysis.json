  "description": "Parallels Desktop Updater **Protection Mechanism Failure** Software Downgrade Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to downgrade Parallels software on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Updater service. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of version information before performing an update**. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19481.",

CWE-20 is a high-level class, while other CWEs considered are often children or related to input validation issues. The description clearly states **lack of proper validation**, making CWE-20 a strong candidate.

While other CWEs such as CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment) and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) were considered based on the impact (privilege escalation), the root cause is clearly input validation. The final decision favors CWE-20 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause. CWE-269 is included as a secondary CWE due to its relevance to the privilege escalation aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the phrase \"**lack of proper validation of version information before performing an update**\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-20, which states \"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-20 being a Class and CWE-269 being a Base.
