# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45818

## Vulnerability Description
The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM guests, when the (virtual) VGA is in standard mode. Locking involved there has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the return from the function that acquired it. This behavior results in a problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which arent relevant here). When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already being held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a **deadlock**. This **deadlock** was already found when the code was first introduced, but was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete. Analysis in light of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking discipline work. In staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7. Therefore, we are fixing the locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature. Note that even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-45818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The hypervisor has code for accelerating VGA memory accesses for HVM guests in "standard" mode.
- The locking mechanism used leaves a lock acquired after the function that acquired it returns.
- When emulating an instruction with two memory accesses to VGA memory, the held lock is re-acquired during the second access, leading to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect locking discipline where a lock is held past the return of the function that acquired it.
- Re-entrancy issues when emulating instructions with multiple memory accesses to VGA memory.
- The locking mechanism was incorrectly analyzed, resulting in an incomplete fix upon its introduction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A HVM guest kernel (potentially not malicious) can cause a deadlock, locking up the entire host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A HVM guest needs to execute instructions that perform two memory accesses to VGA memory.
- This could occur from normal operations within a guest or be triggered intentionally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a HVM guest running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- The guest must be able to execute instructions leading to two memory accesses to VGA memory.

**Vulnerable Systems:**
- Xen versions 4.6 through 4.19 are affected.
- Only x86 systems running HVM guests are vulnerable.
- PV and PVH guests are not vulnerable.
- Staging versions (4.20 dev) are not vulnerable as the flawed feature has been removed.

**Mitigation:**
- Running only PV or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.
- Applying the provided patches for the vulnerable Xen versions. These patches remove the problematic VGA acceleration code which was accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.
