## Vulnerability Description
NetAlertX 24.7.18 before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated file reading because an HTTP client can ignore a redirect, and because of factors related to strpos and **directory traversal**, as exploited in the wild in May 2025. This is related to components/logs.php.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **directory traversal**
- **impact:** unauthenticated file reading
- **vector:** ignoring redirect
- **attacker:** HTTP client
- **product:** NetAlertX
- **version:** 24.7.18 before 24.10.12
- **component:** components/logs.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary

Root cause of vulnerability:
*   The logs.php endpoint does not require authentication and is vulnerable to path traversal.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Path traversal vulnerability.
*   Improper authentication in logs.php endpoint.

Impact of exploitation:
*   An attacker can read any file due to path traversal vulnerability.

Attack vectors:
*   Sending a POST request to the logs.php endpoint with a crafted payload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   Unauthenticated attacker.
