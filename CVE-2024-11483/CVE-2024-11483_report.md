# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-11483

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11483

## Description

A vulnerability was found in the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This flaw allows attackers to escalate privileges by **improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access**. This issue affects API endpoints that rely on ansible_base.oauth2_provider for OAuth2 authentication. While the impact is limited to actions within the users assigned permissions, it undermines scoped access controls, potentially allowing unintended modifications in the application and consuming services.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access
- **Impact:** escalate privileges
- **Attacker:** attackers
- **Product:** Ansible Automation Platform
- **Component:** API endpoints

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate CWE | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level CWE. While ideally, a Base or Variant level CWE is preferred, CWE-863 accurately captures the essence of the authorization flaw where the system incorrectly authorizes actions. CWE-266 is a possible weakness since an incorrect privilege is assigned to a user based on the OAuth2 token. The graph shows that CWE-863 is a child of CWE-923 which covers weaknesses of the web domain.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper leveraging of read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access**. This leads to **privilege escalation**, allowing attackers to perform unintended modifications within the application and consuming services.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the vulnerability allows attackers to **improperly leverage read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access**, leading to privilege escalation. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the root cause is "Improper scope handling in OAuth2 tokens within the automation-gateway component." This aligns with the definition of CWE-863, which describes a situation where the product performs an authorization check, but does it incorrectly.

The selection of CWE-863 is at the appropriate level of specificity because it focuses on the incorrect authorization check related to OAuth2 scopes, rather than a more general authorization issue. While the guidance suggests using a Base-level CWE when possible, the Class-level CWE-863 is chosen here because it accurately represents the nature of the authorization flaw.

The analysis considered other CWEs, such as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), but these were deemed less appropriate because the issue is not a complete lack of authorization or authentication, but rather an incorrect implementation of authorization checks related to OAuth2 scopes.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
