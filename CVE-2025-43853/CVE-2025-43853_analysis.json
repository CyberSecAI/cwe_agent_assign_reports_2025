  "description": "The WebAssembly Micro Runtimes (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface. Anyone running WAMR up to and including version 2.2.0 or WAMR built with libc-uvwasi on Windows is affected by a **symlink following vulnerability**. On WAMR running in Windows, creating a symlink pointing outside of the preopened directory and subsequently opening it with create flag will create a file on host outside of the sandbox. If the symlink points to an existing host file, its also possible to open it and read its content. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-43853 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content is relevant to CVE-2025-43853. It details a filesystem sandbox escape vulnerability in wasm-micro-runtime. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nCreating a symlink pointing outside of the preopened directory and subsequently opening it with the create flag allows a file to be created on the host outside of the sandbox. If the symlink points to an existing host file, it's also possible to open and read its content. The uvwasi implementation doesn't properly validate the symlink path.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Filesystem sandbox escape\n*   Improper symlink handling in uvwasi\n*   Lack of validation of symlink paths\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUntrusted Wasm modules can access the host filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data theft.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A malicious Wasm module can create symlinks pointing outside the sandbox.\n*   The module can then open these symlinks to create or read files on the host system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to execute a Wasm module within the wasm-micro-runtime environment.\n*   No specific privileges are required within the host system.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2.3.0 or later of iwasm.\n*   The commit 28702ed addresses the issue by updating libuv and uvwasi versions and adding a workaround to check if the old path is valid before creating the symlink.\n*   The commit also adds a warning about the limitations of uvwasi's filesystem security properties.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows.\n*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided in Rust using the `wasi` crate.\n*   The PoC demonstrates creating a symlink and then opening it to create a file outside the sandbox and read an existing file.\n*   CVSS v4 score is 7.0/10.\n*   The vulnerability is related to the uvwasi feature and the use of libuv.\n*   The commit updates libuv to v1.51.0 and uvwasi to v0.0.21.\n*   The commit adds a warning that uvwasi does not currently provide comprehensive filesystem security properties.",

CWE-367 is included due to the time-of-check-time-of-use nature of symlink resolution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe73 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe59\n    cwe367 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper link resolution (CWE-59)** where the program does not properly prevent a filename from resolving to an unintended resource. This is compounded by **external control of file name or path (CWE-73)**, where user input influences the file system operations and a **time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367)**, where the state of the resource changes between the check and the use.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-59 as the primary weakness due to the **symlink following vulnerability**. The vulnerability description clearly states that \"On WAMR running in Windows, creating a symlink pointing outside of the preopened directory and subsequently opening it with create flag will create a file on host outside of the sandbox.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-59, which involves **improper link resolution**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-59 having a high similarity score. The analysis also considered the potential for a race condition, CWE-367, given the nature of symlink resolution, where the target of the link might change between the time it's checked and the time it's used. I'm adding CWE-73 because the file name or path is influenced by external factors in this scenario.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-59, CWE-73 and CWE-367 provides the optimal level of specificity, capturing the core weakness and related contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
