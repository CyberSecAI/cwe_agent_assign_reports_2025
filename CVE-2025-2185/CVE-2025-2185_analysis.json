CWE-319, related to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the potential impact of the **insufficient session expiration**. The hierarchical relationships did not significantly influence the primary mapping, as CWE-613 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe613\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613), which leads to the transmission of passwords over unencrypted connections (CWE-319). The chain highlights how a weakness in session management can directly result in sensitive data being exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based primarily on the vulnerability description provided, which explicitly states an **insufficient session expiration** vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly support CWE-613 as the primary CWE. The relationship graph emphasizes the connection between **insufficient session expiration** and the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-613 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-319 is identified as the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
