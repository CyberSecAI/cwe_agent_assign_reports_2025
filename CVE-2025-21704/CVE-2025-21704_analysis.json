  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb cdc-acm Check control transfer buffer size before access If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we cant calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can lead to **memory corruption** when the expected_size decreases between fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap. This issue has been present since the beginning of git history however, it only leads to **memory corruption** since commit ea2583529cd1 (cdc-acm reassemble fragmented notifications). A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace has opened /dev/ttyACM* but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will do that automatically depending on the USB devices vendor/product IDs and its other interfaces.",

CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) and CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)) are contributing factors. CWE-130 relates to the **incorrect handling of length** which precedes the out-of-bounds write and CWE-191 relates to the calculation of expected size which results in wraparound.

The evidence is based on the description, which indicates that **memory corruption** occurs because the code reads lengths from memory outside the received data, especially when the expected size decreases between fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap. The graph relationships show that CWE-130 and CWE-191 can precede CWE-787.
