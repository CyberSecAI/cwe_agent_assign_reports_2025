  "query": "Toshiba printers will display the password of the admin user in clear-text and additional passwords when sending 2 specific HTTP requests to the internal API. An attacker stealing the cookie of an admin or abusing a XSS vulnerability can recover this password in clear-text and compromise the printer. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability.
