Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays in the guest making all of the extra work theyre doing to synchronize between guest and host useless. Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use. Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on configs with 3d enabled. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-119 CWE-401 CWE-908 CWE-121 CWE-770 CWE-1285 CWE-909 CWE-787 CWE-226",
