  "description": "Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. **ZITADELs user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly**. Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources. Additionally, the management and auth API always returned the state as active or did not provide any information about the state. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly remove the user grants to make sure the user does not get access anymore.",

Deactivated user grants were still included in tokens.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system failed to properly revoke access rights when a user grant was deactivated, leading to the continued provision of access tokens with stale permissions. Additionally, the management and auth API did not reflect the deactivated state.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to applications and resources due to the presence of deactivated user grants in access tokens.\n- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the flawed token generation and validation process.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires low privileges, and some user interaction, to potentially leverage existing valid tokens. An attacker could use valid tokens containing deactivated user grants to access restricted resources until the user grant removal.\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than the CVE description placeholder, including specific vulnerable and patched versions, as well as workarounds and CVSS v3 base metrics.",

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE, while CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a base-level CWE. While a more specific CWE is generally preferred, CWE-863 captures the overall authorization failure more accurately as the core issue. CWE-306 is a potential contributing factor, as the **failure** to properly deactivate user grants effectively leads to a form of **missing** authentication for those grants.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ParentOf| cwe639\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrectly implemented user grant deactivation mechanism**, leading to deactivated user grants being included in tokens. This, in turn, results in unauthorized access to applications and resources.\n\nIncorrect User Grant Deactivation Mechanism -> Deactivated User Grants in Tokens -> Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is that the deactivation mechanism for user grants did not work correctly. The system continued to issue tokens with permissions that should have been revoked. This is primarily an **authorization** issue (CWE-863). While authentication might seem relevant, the core problem is that the system **failed to properly authorize** access based on the deactivation status.\n\nEvidence:\n- \"**ZITADELs user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly**\"\n- \"Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources.\"\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the **failure** to correctly perform the authorization check, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered a secondary weakness because the **failure** to properly deactivate grants effectively means that authentication wasn't being properly enforced for those deactivated grants.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This is a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-863. It's also discouraged.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve user-controlled keys.\n*   CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel): This is not applicable because there isn't an alternate path or channel being exploited.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This is not applicable because the vulnerability isn't directly about inserting sensitive information, but rather about **incorrectly** providing access.\n\nRelevant CWE
