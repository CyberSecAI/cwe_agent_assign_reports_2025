  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-48924', description='### Impact When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce **hash collisions**, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized. This is similar to [a prior advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability. ### Patches The following steps are required to mitigate this risk. 1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available. 1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data. ### Workarounds If upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows 1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`. 2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer()`. 3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object. 4. Use your custom options object for all **deserialization** operations.

Specifically, the library uses the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer` method that did not adequately prevent hash collisions and the stack overflow was due to the deserialization process when handling deeply nested data structures. An attacker can exploit this by crafting messagepack data that forces the hash function to generate many collisions, causing a significant performance degradation and potential for denial of service. The fix includes using the SipHash algorithm to provide collision resistance. Additionally, a patch was released to address the stack overflow issue when deserializing deeply nested data. The patched versions use a collision-resistant hash algorithm and provide checks for maximum allowed depth of the data structure to prevent excessive stack usage during deserialization.\"\\n

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    ### Impact When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce **hash collisions**, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized. This is similar to [a prior advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability. ### Patches The following steps are required to mitigate this risk. 1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available. 1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data. ### Workarounds If upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows 1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`. 2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer()`. 3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object. 4. Use your custom options object for all **deserialization** operations.
