  "description": "### Impact When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce **hash collisions**, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized. This is similar to [a prior advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability. ### Patches The following steps are required to mitigate this risk. 1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available. 1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https//github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data. ### Workarounds If upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows 1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`. 2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer()`. 3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object. 4. Use your custom options object for all **deserialization** operations. This may be by",

Specifically, the library uses the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer` method that did not adequately prevent hash collisions and the stack overflow was due to the deserialization process when handling deeply nested data structures. An attacker can exploit this by crafting messagepack data that forces the hash function to generate many collisions, causing a significant performance degradation and potential for denial of service. The fix includes using the SipHash algorithm to provide collision resistance. Additionally, a patch was released to address the stack overflow issue when deserializing deeply nested data. The patched versions use a collision-resistant hash algorithm and provide checks for maximum allowed depth of the data structure to prevent excessive stack usage during deserialization.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

CWE-407 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-407. However, the vulnerability description focuses on the general problem of inefficient algorithmic complexity caused by hash collisions during deserialization, making the broader CWE-407 more applicable as the primary weakness. CWE-502 and CWE-328 are included as contributing factors related to the attack vector and contributing cause, but not the central flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1321 -->|PEEROF| cwe502\n    cwe347 -->|PEEROF| cwe502\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe502,cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **deserialization** of untrusted data. The **deserialization** process can lead to **hash collisions** if the data is specifically **contrived** to trigger them. These **hash collisions** result in excessive **CPU consumption**, ultimately leading to a **denial of service**. Therefore, the chain is: Untrusted Data -> Deserialization (CWE-502) -> Hash Collisions (CWE-328) -> Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity (CWE-407) -> CPU Consumption -> Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs based on the key phrases in the vulnerability description. The primary concern is the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** (CWE-407) arising from **hash collisions**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the attack is achieved by sending **contrived data** to produce **hash collisions**, leading to large **CPU consumption**.\n\nWhile **deserialization** (CWE-502) is the entry point for the attack, and a **weak hash** (CWE-328) contributes to the collision, the root cause lies in the inefficient handling of these collisions, making CWE-407 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe retriever scores support this decision, with CWE-407 consistently scoring high across different keyphrases. The final selection prioritizes the root cause (algorithmic inefficiency) over the entry point (deserialization) and contributing factor (weak hash). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, capturing the essence of the vulnerability without being overly broad or narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
