No child CWEs were more appropriate in this context. The description clearly indicates **SQL Injection** as the **root cause**, aligning directly with the definition of CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command, leading directly to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **SQL Injection**. The evidence is clear, and the mapping to CWE-89 is direct and well-supported. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top match.
