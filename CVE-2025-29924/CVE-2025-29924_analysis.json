  "cve_id": "CVE-2025-29924",
  "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to 15.10.14, 16.4.6, and 16.10.0-rc-1, its possible for an user to get access to private information through the REST API - but could also be through another API - when a sub wiki is using Prevent unregistered users to view pages. The vulnerability only affects subwikis, and it only concerns specific right options such as Prevent unregistered users to view pages. or Prevent unregistered users to edit pages. Its possible to detect the vulnerability by enabling Prevent unregistered users to view pages and then trying to access a page through the REST API without using any credentials. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.14, 16.4.6 and 16.10.0RC1.",

Several child CWEs exist such as CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) that could be considered more specific. However, the description does not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact authorization failure mechanism. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a base CWE that is related to the impact of the missing authorization, where private information is exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe862\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe425 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862), leading to the **impact** of being able to **get access to private information** (CWE-201). The root cause is that `DefaultAuthorizationManager` doesn't properly set the wiki reference.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards authorization-related CWEs due to the **impact** of unauthorized access to private information. The evidence from the CVE reference links and the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the authorization issues.\n\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authorization** check within the XWiki platform's REST API when accessing pages in subwikis with specific right restrictions enabled, such as \"Prevent unregistered users to view pages\". This allows unauthorized users to access private information, which is a direct result of the **missing authorization**.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) aligns with the core issue: the application **does not adequately enforce authorization**. The vulnerability description specifically mentions that users can gain access to private information through the REST API without credentials when certain restrictions are in place. This indicates a failure in the authorization mechanism.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a secondary CWE because it represents the consequence of the authorization failure. The private information is being exposed due to the lack of proper access controls.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs, such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). However, the issue is not about missing authentication, but rather a **failure in authorization** *after* a user (potentially unauthenticated) attempts to access restricted content.\n\nThe evidence from the Jira ticket and the GitHub advisory confirms that the `DefaultAuthorizationManager` doesn't properly set the wiki reference, leading to the authorization bypass. This supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. While child CWEs of CWE-862 exist, such as CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), the available information doesn't provide enough detail to determine the specific type of authorization bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n-   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** - The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n-   **CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** - The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.",
