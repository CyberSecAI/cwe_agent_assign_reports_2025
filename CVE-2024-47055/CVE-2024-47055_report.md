# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47055

## Description

SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic related to the segment cloning functionality. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to clone segments without proper authorization checks. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Missing Authorization A **missing authorization vulnerability** exists in the cloneAction of the segment management. This allows an authenticated user to bypass intended permission restrictions and clone segments even if they lack the necessary permissions to create new ones. MitigationUpdate Mautic to a version that implements proper authorization checks for the cloneAction within the ListController.php. Ensure that users attempting to clone segments possess the appropriate creation permissions.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing authorization vulnerability
- **Weakness:** insecure direct object reference
- **Impact:** bypass permission restrictions and clone segments
- **Attacker:** authenticated user
- **Product:** Mautic
- **Component:** segment cloning functionality

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the parent-child relationship. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and while there are no specific child CWEs listed in the provided data, the description and guidance strongly suggest it as the correct classification due to the **missing authorization**. CWE-639 and CWE-425 are considered as secondary candidates. The guidance clearly indicates that choosing a Base level CWE is preferred, but in this case, the evidence points more directly to the broader category of **missing authorization** at the Class level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check in the `cloneAction` function. This allows an authenticated user to bypass permission restrictions. The impact is that any authenticated user can clone segments, even if they lack the necessary permissions.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** check. The provided evidence strongly supports this conclusion. The vulnerability description clearly states a "**missing authorization vulnerability**" and that the `cloneAction` lacks proper permission checks. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as a high-scoring candidate.

The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control further solidifies this choice. The vulnerability is not about authentication (verifying the user's identity) but about authorization (verifying what the user is allowed to do). Therefore, CWE-862 is more appropriate than CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) were considered because they also appeared in the Retriever Results. However, the vulnerability description does not indicate that the authorization bypass is achieved through a user-controlled key or direct request, making CWE-862 a better fit.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** check, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, the available information does not point to a more specific Base-level CWE. The mitigating action of implementing authorization checks directly addresses the weakness described by CWE-862.

The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
