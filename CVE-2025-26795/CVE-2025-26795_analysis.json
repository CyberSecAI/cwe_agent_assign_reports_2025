CWE-200 was considered as a potential impact, but given its discouraged usage for representing confidentiality loss, it was only considered as a secondary classification. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that strongly influenced the primary selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file** (CWE-532), which then leads to the exposure of this information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200). The root cause is the logging of sensitive data, and the impact is the potential exposure of this data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary clearly indicate that the vulnerability involves the **insertion of sensitive information into log files**, which is a direct match for CWE-532. While the vulnerability also results in the exposure of sensitive information, this is more of an impact than the root cause. Therefore, CWE-532 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results further support this decision. CWE-532 has a high similarity score and is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n- Vulnerability Description: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File** vulnerability\"\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** ... **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-532 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
