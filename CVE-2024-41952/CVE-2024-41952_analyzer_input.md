# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41952

## Vulnerability Description
Zitadel is an open source identity management system. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesnt exist and report Username or Password invalid. Due to a **implementation change to prevent deadlocks** calling the database, the flag would not be correctly respected in all cases and an attacker would gain information if an account exist within ZITADEL, since the error message shows object not found instead of the generic error message. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.58.1, 2.57.1, 2.56.2, 2.55.5, 2.54.8, and 2.53.9.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **implementation change to prevent deadlocks**
- **impact:** gain information if an account exists
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Zitadel
- **component:** Ignoring unknown usernames setting

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A change was made to prevent deadlocks when calling the database, which caused the 'Ignore unknown usernames' setting to not be respected in all cases. This resulted in the system leaking information about the existence of user accounts through specific error messages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information disclosure via error messages"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can determine whether a user account exists on the system by observing the specific error message returned by the system. This bypasses the protection offered by the 'Ignore unknown usernames' setting.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the network, specifically by attempting authentication against the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send authentication requests to the system. No specific privileges are required and no user interaction is needed."
