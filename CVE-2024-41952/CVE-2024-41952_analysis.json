  "description": "Zitadel is an open source identity management system. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesnt exist and report Username or Password invalid. Due to a **implementation change to prevent deadlocks** calling the database, the flag would not be correctly respected in all cases and an attacker would gain information if an account exist within ZITADEL, since the error message shows object not found instead of the generic error message. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.58.1, 2.57.1, 2.56.2, 2.55.5, 2.54.8, and 2.53.9.",

The choice of CWE-203 was based on the fact that the vulnerability reveals security-relevant information (user account existence) through differing responses, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-203.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe203 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of events can be described as follows:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Implementation change to prevent deadlocks** when calling the database.\n2.  **Weakness:** The \"Ignore unknown usernames\" setting is not correctly respected.\n3.  **Impact:** Information disclosure: an attacker can determine if an account exists by observing specific error messages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weakness. The primary CWE, CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), was chosen because it directly reflects the vulnerability where the system's differing responses reveal sensitive information.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that due to an **implementation change to prevent deadlocks**, the \"Ignore unknown usernames\" setting was not correctly respected, leading to different error messages based on whether a username exists. This directly matches the description of CWE-203, where the product behaves differently under different circumstances, exposing security-relevant information.\n\nThe retriever results also support
