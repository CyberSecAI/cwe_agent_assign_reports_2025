## Vulnerability Description
The BP Profile Shortcodes Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the tab parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **time-based SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **vector:** tab parameter
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** BP Profile Shortcodes Extra WordPress plugin
- **version:** up to and including 2.6.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11732

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the 'tab' parameter within the BP Profile Shortcodes Extra plugin. The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied input within the 'tab' parameter, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (SQL injection)
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Lack of sufficient preparation of SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- Potential for extracting sensitive information from the database.
- The vulnerability is time-based, which can be used to determine if a query is successful.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `tab` parameter of the plugin's shortcodes, specifically when processing the `bp_xprofile_groups` table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
- No user interaction is required, making exploitation relatively straightforward once the attacker has an authorized account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been temporarily closed pending a full review.
- There is no known patch available.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis of Wordfence.
