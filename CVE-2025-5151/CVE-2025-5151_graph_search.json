The code maintainer explains, that [they] have added some workarounds to address this in #502, but will not be implementing a full fix. This is because this repo is meant to be run in a docker environment, which will significantly mitigate potential security risks. Having said that, we have added a SECURITY section in our README to make this clearer to users. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-212 CWE-79 CWE-1336 CWE-95 CWE-89 CWE-94 CWE-88 CWE-93",
