This leads to **privilege escalation**, which can be represented as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Improper Access Control (CWE-284).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is a **heap overflow** (CWE-122) in Zoom Workplace Apps. The vulnerability description clearly states this **weakness**, and the CVE reference links content summary confirms it. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is privilege escalation, which is why I have selected CWE-250 and CWE-284 as secondary CWEs.\n\nThe selection of CWE-122 is based on the explicit mention of a \"heap overflow\" in the vulnerability description: \"**Heap overflow** in some Zoom Workplace Apps may allow an authenticated user to conduct an escalation of privilege via network access.\"\n\nThe relationship between CWE-122 and CWE-119 influenced the selection, as CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119. The more specific variant was chosen because the evidence supports it.\n\nCWE-250 was selected because of the impact of privilege escalation. It describes the scenario where code runs with higher privileges than necessary.\n\nThe assigned CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** (CWE-122) and the potential impact (CWE-250, CWE-284) of the vulnerability.\n\nCWEs like Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190), Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131), and Off-by-one Error (CWE-193) were considered but not selected because the primary **weakness** is a **heap overflow**, not an integer error or buffer size calculation error.",
