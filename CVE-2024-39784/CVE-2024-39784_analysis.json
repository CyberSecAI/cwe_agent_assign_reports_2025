  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-39784 Content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-39784. It provides a detailed vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nImproper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection'). Specifically, the `nas.cgi` script doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `disk_part` and `adddir_name` parameters before using them in system commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CVE-2024-39784:** Command injection in the `nas.cgi` script's `add_dir()` function via the `disk_part` parameter.\n*   **CVE-2024-39785:** Command injection in the `nas.cgi` script's `add_dir()` function via the `adddir_name` parameter.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nArbitrary command execution on the Wavlink AC3000 router. This allows an attacker to potentially take full control of the device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `nas.cgi` script with malicious input in the `disk_part` or `adddir_name` parameters. Authentication is required (attacker needs to be an authenticated user).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router.\n*   Authenticated access to the web interface (requires valid credentials).\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not specify a direct fix, but states the vendor is working on patches. The product has been discontinued.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `add_dir()` function of the `nas.cgi` script.\n*   The `web_get()` function is used to retrieve parameters from the HTTP request.\n*   The `do_system()` function is used to execute system commands.\n*   The input is not properly sanitized before being passed to `do_system()`, leading to the command injection.\n*   The report provides specific code snippets showing the vulnerable functions and parameters.\n*   CVSSv3 Score: 9.1 (Critical)\n*   CWE: CWE-74\n*   Affected Product: Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505\n*   Timeline of disclosure is provided.",

Since the evidence clearly points to OS command injection, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice.

This leads to OS command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\nImproper Input Neutralization -> OS Command Injection -> Arbitrary Command Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-77, CWE-78, CWE-89, and CWE-74. After reviewing the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links, it became clear that the root cause is **improper neutralization** of input leading to OS command injection. The Talos Intelligence report explicitly mentions the **improper sanitization** of the `disk_part` parameter before being used in system commands. The report also mentions that CWE-74 is related.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting that CWE-78 is a specific type of injection, making it more appropriate than the general CWE-74.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the type of injection vulnerability (OS command injection) present in the Wavlink AC3000 router.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer.
