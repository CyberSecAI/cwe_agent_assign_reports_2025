## Vulnerability Description
Multiple command execution vulnerabilities exist in the nas.cgi add_dir() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.A **command injection** vulnerability exists in the disk_part POST parameter.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-39784 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-39784. It provides a detailed vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection'). Specifically, the `nas.cgi` script doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `disk_part` and `adddir_name` parameters before using them in system commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CVE-2024-39784:** Command injection in the `nas.cgi` script's `add_dir()` function via the `disk_part` parameter.
*   **CVE-2024-39785:** Command injection in the `nas.cgi` script's `add_dir()` function via the `adddir_name` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Arbitrary command execution on the Wavlink AC3000 router. This allows an attacker to potentially take full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `nas.cgi` script with malicious input in the `disk_part` or `adddir_name` parameters. Authentication is required (attacker needs to be an authenticated user).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router.
*   Authenticated access to the web interface (requires valid credentials).
*   Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does not specify a direct fix, but states the vendor is working on patches. The product has been discontinued.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `add_dir()` function of the `nas.cgi` script.
*   The `web_get()` function is used to retrieve parameters from the HTTP request.
*   The `do_system()` function is used to execute system commands.
*   The input is not properly sanitized before being passed to `do_system()`, leading to the command injection.
*   The report provides specific code snippets showing the vulnerable functions and parameters.
*   CVSSv3 Score: 9.1 (Critical)
*   CWE: CWE-74
*   Affected Product: Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
*   Timeline of disclosure is provided.
