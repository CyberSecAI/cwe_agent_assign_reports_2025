  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3605\n\n**Vulnerability Description:**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query within the WP Hotel Booking plugin. Specifically, the `room_type` parameter of the `/wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms` REST API endpoint is vulnerable.\n\n*   **Weakness:**  The plugin fails to sanitize or properly prepare the `room_type` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the existing query, potentially allowing them to:\n    *   Extract sensitive information from the database.\n    *   Modify or delete data within the database.\n\n*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms` REST API endpoint by manipulating the `room_type` parameter.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**\n    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they can trigger the vulnerability directly.\n    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the affected WordPress instance and knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and parameter.\n\n**Affected Software:**\n\n*   **Plugin:** WP Hotel Booking\n*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 2.1.0\n*   **Patched Version:** 2.1.1\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is categorized as \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\".\n*   It has a critical CVSS score of 10.0.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof Zaj\u0105c of CERT PL.\n*   The patch involves updating to version 2.1.1 or a newer patched version.\n\nThe changelog also mentions multiple \"security\" fixes in various versions, but the provided text does not give details about other vulnerabilities or any details that are not related to CVE-2024-3605.",
