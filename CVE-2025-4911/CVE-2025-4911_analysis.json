  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4911 Content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability report, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the \"viewid\" parameter in the `/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering/modification\n*   Potential for complete system control\n*   Disruption of services\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The \"viewid\" parameter in a GET request to `/zms/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php` is the attack vector.\n*   The report provides example payloads for boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query attacks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP GET requests.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Employ prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the primary recommended mitigation.\n*   **Conduct input validation and filtering:**  Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** PHPGurukul Zoo Management System\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://phpgurukul.com/zoo-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/](https://phpgurukul.com/zoo-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php`\n*   **Version:** V2.1\n*   **Software Link:** [https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm\\_process\\_download=1&download\\_id=12723](https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=12723)\n*   The report includes example HTTP request packets and screenshots from `sqlmap` demonstrating the vulnerability.",

No parent-child or chain relationships were relevant in this case, as the vulnerability is a straightforward SQL injection. The abstraction level is appropriate, as CWE-89 is a Base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single weakness: **improper neutralization** of special elements leading to **SQL Injection**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization**\n  - Impact: **SQL Injection**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability involves the manipulation of the `viewid` argument in `/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php`, leading to **SQL injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `viewid` parameter.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
