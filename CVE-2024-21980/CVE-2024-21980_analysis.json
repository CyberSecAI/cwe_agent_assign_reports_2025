While CWE-119 is a broader category, CWE-787 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n*   CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write: This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability specifically involves a write operation outside the intended memory boundary. The description explicitly states that the hypervisor can \"overwrite a guests memory or UMC seed.\" This aligns with the definition of CWE-787.\n*   CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: This CWE is a broader category that includes out-of-bounds writes.
