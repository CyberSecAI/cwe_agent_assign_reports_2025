  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-46655 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details an **Insecure File Upload Vulnerability** in CodiMD (versions v2.5.4 - v2.2.1 and \u2264v2.2.0), reported by ZAST.AI. This vulnerability allows attackers to upload malicious files, potentially leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability details extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   **High-Version (v2.5.4 - v2.2.1):**  The application uses the Formidable module for file uploads with `keepExtensions` set to true, preserving original file extensions. While `checkImageValid` attempts validation, SVG files are allowed, which are susceptible to XSS.  The application uploads files to a remote S3 server, bypassing CSP restrictions.\n*   **Low-Version (\u2264 v2.2.0):**  Lack of file validation mechanisms. The code doesn't implement checks like `checkImageValid` to verify file legitimacy.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure file upload.\n*   Insufficient input validation.\n*   Allowing potentially dangerous file types (SVG in higher versions).\n*   Bypass of Content Security Policy (CSP) due to remote file storage.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n*   Potential for attackers to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **High-Version:** Uploading a malicious SVG file.\n*   **Low-Version:** Uploading any arbitrary file type (potentially including malicious scripts).\n*   Exploitation involves uploading a file and then accessing it via its URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated user (for the demonstrated exploit on the demo site).\n*   Ability to upload files to the server.\n*   Understanding of XSS vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious payloads.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies the need for:\n\n*   Stronger file validation to prevent the upload of dangerous file types.\n*   Sanitization of uploaded files.\n*   Review and strengthening of the CSP policy.\n*   Consideration of where files are stored (same-origin vs. remote) and the implications for CSP.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The report details successful exploitation on the official demo site ([https://hedgedoc.org/history/](https://hedgedoc.org/history/)).\n*   The CSP policy in lower versions attempts to mitigate XSS, but can be bypassed by uploading to a remote server.\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code snippets and proof-of-concept steps.",

The file upload allows for the introduction of malicious content, which is then executed in the context of a web page.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe79 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain starts with the **CWE-434** [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] where a malicious SVG file is uploaded. The lack of proper input validation and sanitization leads to **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], allowing the execution of the malicious script within the user's browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis identifies **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as the primary weakness, resulting from the **lack of input sanitization**. The vulnerability description mentions **XSS through uploaded SVG documents**, which aligns directly with CWE-79. The ability to upload a dangerous file type (SVG) is facilitated by **CWE-434** [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type], which is a prerequisite for the XSS.\n\nThe selection is heavily based on the vulnerability description that explicitly states **XSS through uploaded SVG documents**.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
