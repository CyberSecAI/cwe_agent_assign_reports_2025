  "query": "All the Toshiba printers contain a shell script using the same hardcoded key to encrypt logs. An attacker can decrypt the encrypted files using the hardcoded key. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability.
