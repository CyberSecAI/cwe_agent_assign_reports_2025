  "query": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** This vulnerability exists in D3D Security IP Camera D8801 due to usage of weak authentication scheme of the HTTP header protocol where authorization tag contain a Base-64 encoded username and password. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a HTTP packet leading to exposure of user credentials of the targeted device. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
