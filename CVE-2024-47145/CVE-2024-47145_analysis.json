CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, but it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** issue described in the vulnerability. The analysis considered the \"child-of\" relationships, however, the evidence did not provide enough information to select a more specific CWE variant. CWE-200 represents the impact of the **incorrect authorization**, which is the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly authorize access** (CWE-863), which leads to the **exposure of posts and files** (CWE-200).\n- **Root Cause:** **Incorrect authorization** leading to unauthorized access.\n- **Impact:** **Exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary candidate due to the **failure to properly authorize access** to archived channels. The retriever results listed CWE-863 as the top candidate. The vulnerability description clearly states that the system **fails to properly authorize access**, which is the root cause. CWE-200 was considered as a secondary CWE since the **impact** of the vulnerability is the **exposure of sensitive information**. The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description: \"Mattermost versions 9.5.x <= 9.5.8 **fail to properly authorize access to archived channels when viewing archived channels is disabled**, which allows an attacker to view posts and files of archived channels via file links.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between **incorrect authorization** and **exposure of sensitive information**.
