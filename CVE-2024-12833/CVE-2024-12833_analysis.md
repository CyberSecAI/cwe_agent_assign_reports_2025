# Analysis for CVE-2024-12833

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.8 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship is that CWE-79 and CWE-306 are both children of higher-level classes related to input validation and authentication respectively. CWE-79 is a base CWE that is related to improper neutralization of input. CWE-306, on the other hand, falls under the category of authentication and access control, specifically dealing with the absence of authentication mechanisms for critical functionalities. There is no direct parent-child relationship between the two.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** in the PRTG Network Monitor web interface. This leads to the injection of an arbitrary script (CWE-79), which results in an authentication bypass (CWE-306), allowing network-adjacent attackers to gain unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis identified two potential CWEs: CWE-79 for the **Cross-Site Scripting** (**injection**) due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and CWE-306 for the authentication bypass.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leading to **Cross-Site Scripting, injection**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-79, which deals with the improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The description also states that this vulnerability leads to an authentication bypass.

The retriever results also list CWE-79.

The evidence from the vulnerability description, especially the phrases related to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and the resulting **Cross-Site Scripting, injection**, strongly supports the selection of CWE-79 as the primary root cause. The authentication bypass is a consequence of the XSS, making CWE-306 a secondary concern.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1576.23
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
