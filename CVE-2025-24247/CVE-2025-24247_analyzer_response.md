# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-24247

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**type confusion**" as the root cause. |
| CWE-755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability results in "unexpected app termination", which could be due to an unhandled exception. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-843 (**Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**).

CWE-755 (**Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**) is considered as a secondary weakness, as the impact is "unexpected app termination."

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with a **type confusion** (CWE-843), which leads to "unexpected app termination."

Type Confusion -> Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness identified is CWE-843 (**Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**), based on the explicit mention of "**type confusion**" in the vulnerability description as the root cause. This is further supported by the retriever results, which list CWE-843 as the top combined result.

CWE-755 (**Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**) is a possible secondary weakness, stemming from the "unexpected app termination", indicating a failure to properly handle an exceptional condition that arose due to the type confusion.

The selection of CWE-843 as the primary weakness is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly corresponds to the identified root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
