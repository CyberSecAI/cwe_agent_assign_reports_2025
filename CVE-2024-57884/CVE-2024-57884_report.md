# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-57884

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm vmscan account for free pages to prevent infinite Loop in throttle_direct_reclaim() The task sometimes continues looping in throttle_direct_reclaim() because allow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) keeps returning false. #0 [ffff80002cb6f8d0] __switch_to at ffff8000080095ac #1 [ffff80002cb6f900] __schedule at ffff800008abbd1c #2 [ffff80002cb6f990] schedule at ffff800008abc50c #3 [ffff80002cb6f9b0] throttle_direct_reclaim at ffff800008273550 #4 [ffff80002cb6fa20] try_to_free_pages at ffff800008277b68 #5 [ffff80002cb6fae0] __alloc_pages_nodemask at ffff8000082c4660 #6 [ffff80002cb6fc50] alloc_pages_vma at ffff8000082e4a98 #7 [ffff80002cb6fca0] do_anonymous_page at ffff80000829f5a8 #8 [ffff80002cb6fce0] __handle_mm_fault at ffff8000082a5974 #9 [ffff80002cb6fd90] handle_mm_fault at ffff8000082a5bd4 At this point, the pgdat contains the following two zones NODE 4 ZONE 0 ADDR ffff00817fffe540 NAME DMA32 SIZE 20480 MIN/LOW/HIGH 11/28/45 VM_STAT NR_FREE_PAGES 359 NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_ANON 18813 NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_ANON 0 NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_FILE 50 NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_FILE 0 NR_ZONE_UNEVICTABLE 0 NR_ZONE_WRITE_PENDING 0 NR_MLOCK 0 NR_BOUNCE 0 NR_ZSPAGES 0 NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES 0 NODE 4 ZONE 1 ADDR ffff00817fffec00 NAME Normal SIZE 8454144 PRESENT 98304 MIN/LOW/HIGH 68/166/264 VM_STAT NR_FREE_PAGES 146 NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_ANON 94668 NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_ANON 3 NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_FILE 735 NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_FILE 78 NR_ZONE_UNEVICTABLE 0 NR_ZONE_WRITE_PENDING 0 NR_MLOCK 0 NR_BOUNCE 0 NR_ZSPAGES 0 NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES 0 In allow_direct_reclaim(), while processing ZONE_DMA32, the sum of inactive/active file-backed pages calculated in zone_reclaimable_pages() based on the result of zone_page_state_snapshot() is zero. Additionally, since this system lacks swap, the calculation of inactive/ active anonymous pages is skipped. crash> p nr_swap_pages nr_swap_pages = $1937 = { counter = 0 } As a result, ZONE_DMA32 is deemed unreclaimable and skipped, moving on to the processing of the next zone, ZONE_NORMAL, despite ZONE_DMA32 having free pages significantly exceeding the high watermark. The problem is that the pgdat->kswapd_failures hasnt been incremented. crash> px ((struct pglist_data *) 0xffff00817fffe540)->kswapd_failures $1935 = 0x0 This is because the node deemed balanced. The node balancing logic in balance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively. If one or more zones (e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, the entire node is deemed balanced. This causes balance_pgdat() to exit early before incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overall memory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remain under significant pressure. The patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages (NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages are available (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages). This change prevents zones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from being mistakenly deemed unreclaimable. By doing so, the patch ensures proper node balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL, and prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused by allow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false. The kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), caused by a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certain zones, such as ZONE_NORMAL. This issue arises from zone_reclaimable_pages ---truncated---

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Addresses the root cause of the **infinite loop**. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE - The infinite loop leads to **resource consumption**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition). This leads directly to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as the loop continues indefinitely, consuming resources. CWE-835 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-400 is a Class level CWE. The choice of CWE-835 is preferred due to its specific description of the **infinite loop** condition described in the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with an incorrect calculation of reclaimable pages leading to incorrect node balancing. This incorrect node balancing then leads to an infinite loop within the `throttle_direct_reclaim()` function which results in a kernel hang due to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.

Incorrect calculation of reclaimable pages -> Incorrect Node Balancing -> CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition -> CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focused on identifying the root cause and subsequent impacts described in the vulnerability. The primary CWE, CWE-835, directly addresses the **infinite loop** caused by a task stuck in `throttle_direct_reclaim()`. Supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description indicating that the task "sometimes continues looping". This loop condition directly leads to a denial-of-service condition through **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which is represented by the secondary CWE, CWE-400.

The graph relationships highlight the progression from the initial flaw (incorrect calculation) to the final impact (**uncontrolled resource consumption**). The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-835 being a base-level CWE that accurately represents the **looping condition**, and CWE-400 being a class-level CWE that describes the resulting impact.
