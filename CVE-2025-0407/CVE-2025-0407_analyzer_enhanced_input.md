## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0407 related content

The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `gymxmjpa` project on GitHub.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `hyname` parameter in the `query` method of `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/EquipmentController.java` is not properly filtered, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially extract information from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands (depending on the database system and privileges). The provided examples demonstrate the ability to determine the database length and characters of the database name.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker can craft malicious SQL queries by manipulating the `hyname` parameter in the HTTP request to the `/qc/query` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required based on the provided information.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause indicates that proper input validation and sanitization of the `hyname` parameter are necessary to prevent SQL injection. Using parameterized queries or prepared statements is a recommended practice.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides detailed examples of exploiting the vulnerability to determine the length of the database name and its characters. The database name is identified as "gym".
