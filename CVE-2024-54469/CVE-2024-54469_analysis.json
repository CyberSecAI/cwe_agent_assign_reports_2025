CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere is a potential secondary weakness, which suggests that the inherited permissions lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n    cwe274[\"CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe277 -->|CHILDOF| cwe274\n    cwe274 -->|CHILDOF| cwe266\n    cwe277 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe497\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe277 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure inherited permissions** (CWE-277), which allows a local user to access resources or data they should not have access to. This then leads to the **exposure of sensitive user information** (CWE-497).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the evidence, the vulnerability allows a local user to leak sensitive user information due to **improved checks** being missed in the FileProvider component. This suggests an issue with permissions or access control.\n\nCWE-277 Insecure Inherited Permissions is chosen as the primary CWE because it addresses the root cause: the **improper granting of permissions** to a local user, allowing them to access sensitive information. The evidence states that a local user can leak information, indicating they have permissions they shouldn't have.\n\nCWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere is a secondary CWE because it describes the impact of the vulnerability: the **leak of sensitive user information**. This is a direct consequence of the insecure permissions.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-787, CWE-843, CWE-665, CWE-415, and CWE-20 as potentially relevant. However, these CWEs don't directly match the vulnerability description as well as CWE-277 and CWE-497. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-843 (Type Confusion) are memory corruption issues, which are not indicated in the description. CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are memory management issues, which are also not directly indicated. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is too general and doesn't capture the specific nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** (insecure permissions) and the **impact** (information exposure). They are also supported by the evidence provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
