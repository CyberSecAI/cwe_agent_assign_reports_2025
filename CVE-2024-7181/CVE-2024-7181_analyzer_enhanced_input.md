## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in TOTOLINK A3600R 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102. This vulnerability affects the function setTelnetCfg of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument telnet_enabled leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-272602 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of telnet_enabled argument
- **product:** TOTOLINK A3600R
- **version:** 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102
- **component:** /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi:setTelnetCfg function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `setTelnetCfg` function of the TOTOLINK A3600R router firmware.
- The `telnet_enabled` parameter, received via a POST request, is directly used without proper sanitization. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `telnet_enabled` parameter. An attacker can insert arbitrary shell commands within this parameter.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The application directly uses user-provided input in a system command, which is a classic insecure coding practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious commands, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could give the attacker full control over the device, allowing them to steal data, modify configurations, or use the router as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, including the `telnet_enabled` parameter with malicious shell commands and the "topicurl":"setting/setTelnetCfg".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication:**  It appears that the attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid `SESSION_ID` cookie, according to the provided POC, implying that the exploit requires authentication.
