# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10559

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Airport Booking Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function details of the component Passport Number Handler. The manipulation leads to **buffer overflow**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** SourceCodester Airport Booking Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** Passport Number Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the use of the unsafe `gets()` function in the "Airport Booking Management System in C with Source Code 1.0" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `gets()` function is used to read input for the `passport` field, which is allocated a buffer of 6 bytes. The `gets()` function does not perform any bounds checking.
- This lack of input size limitation allows an attacker to supply more than 6 characters, resulting in a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The buffer overflow overwrites adjacent memory.
- This can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to hijack control flow of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user input to the `passport` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and supply user input to the vulnerable field.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to run the main program and select the option that leads to the vulnerable `gets()` call.
- The attacker must be able to provide a string longer than 6 bytes when prompted for a passport number.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located on line 73 of the main program file of the application.
- The provided code snippet also gives an example of how to remediate the vulnerability.
- The suggested fix is to replace `gets()` with `fgets()` and to implement input validation.
