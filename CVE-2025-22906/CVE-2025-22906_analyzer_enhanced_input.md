## Vulnerability Description
RE11S v1.11 was discovered to contain a **command injection** vulnerability via the L2TPUserName parameter at /goform/setWAN.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** RE11S
- **version:** v1.11
- **component:** /goform/setWAN

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content from github.com relates to CVE-2025-22906. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `setWAN` function in the webs file within the bin directory contains a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
System command injection. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary commands on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `L2TPUserName` key value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setWAN` endpoint of the router.

**Mitigation or fix:**
Not specified in the provided content.

**Additional Details:**
The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit using a Python script (`poc.py`) that demonstrates how to inject commands via the `L2TPUserName` parameter. The script shows how to create a file (`/tmp/hack-setWAN`) as proof of successful command execution. The content also provides instructions on how to simulate the router using `firmAE`.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the PoC exploit and simulation instructions.
