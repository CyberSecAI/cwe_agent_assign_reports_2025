# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-10986

# Vulnerability Description

    GPT Academic version 3.83 is vulnerable to a Local File Read (LFI) vulnerability through its HotReload function. This function can download and extract tar.gz files from arxiv.org. Despite implementing protections against **path traversal**, the application overlooks the Tarslip triggered by symlinks. This oversight allows attackers to read arbitrary local files from the victim server.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'symlink Tarslip'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 327.52)

The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....

### 2. CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following (Score: 325.51)

The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files....

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory....

### 4. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (Score: 277.78)

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location th...
