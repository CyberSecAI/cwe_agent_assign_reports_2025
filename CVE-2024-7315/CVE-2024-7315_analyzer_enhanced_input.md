## Vulnerability Description
The Migration, Backup, Staging WordPress plugin before 0.9.106 **does not use sufficient randomness in the filename** that is created when generating a backup, which could be bruteforced by attackers to leak sensitive information about said backups.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not use sufficient randomness in the filename**
- **impact:** leak sensitive information
- **vector:** bruteforce
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Migration Backup Staging WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 0.9.106

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient randomness in the filename generation for backup files. The filename uses a predictable timestamp format, which can be guessed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable filename generation leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive backup data by brute-forcing the filename of backup files.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, attacker needs to know when a backup was performed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need an approximate idea of when the backup was created. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
