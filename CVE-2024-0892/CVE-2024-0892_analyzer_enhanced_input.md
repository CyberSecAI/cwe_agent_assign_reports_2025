## Vulnerability Description
The Schema App Structured Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on the MarkUpdate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update and delete post metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing or incorrect nonce validation**
- **weakness:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery**
- **impact:** update and delete post metadata
- **vector:** forged request
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Schema App Structured Data plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.2.0
- **component:** MarkUpdate function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `MarkUpdate` function within the Schema App Structured Data plugin. This function is responsible for updating and deleting post metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper nonce verification when handling requests to update or delete post metadata. This allows an attacker to forge a request that, if triggered by a logged-in administrator, could lead to unauthorized data modification.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** While not explicitly stated, the use of `sanitize_textarea_field` and `sanitize_key` suggests that the plugin attempts to sanitize input, but the core issue is the lack of nonce validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Metadata Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete post metadata. This could potentially alter the schema data associated with posts, impacting SEO and how search engines perceive the website.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on how the plugin uses the metadata, the attacker may be able to inject malicious data that could lead to other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Requests:** The attack involves creating a malicious request that mimics a legitimate request to the `MarkUpdate` function.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious page, that executes the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have a valid account on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated administrator to perform an action that triggers the forged request.
- **Knowledge of the Plugin:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided code snippets show the vulnerable `MarkupUpdate` function and the nonce check within it.
- The code also shows the generation of a nonce using `wp_create_nonce` and its localization for use in javascript.
- The fix involves adding the correct nonce verification, likely using `wp_verify_nonce`, before updating or deleting post meta.
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 2.2.0 of the plugin. Version 2.2.1 has patched this vulnerability
