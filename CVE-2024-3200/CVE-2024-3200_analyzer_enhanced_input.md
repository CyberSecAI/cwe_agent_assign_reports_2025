## Vulnerability Description
The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the slug attribute of the wpforo shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 2.3.3
- **component:** slug attribute of the wpforo shortcode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation when handling the 'slug' attribute within the 'wpforo' shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input ('slug' attribute) before incorporating it into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the WordPress database by appending additional SQL queries to existing ones.
*  **Data Modification or Deletion**: Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can also potentially lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data, which represents a high-impact scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the 'wpforo' shortcode, specifically by manipulating the 'slug' attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site. This implies they need a valid user account with the ability to create or modify content that uses the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to insert and use the 'wpforo' shortcode with a malicious 'slug' attribute.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The wpForo Forum plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection. An authenticated attacker (contributor level or higher) can exploit the lack of proper sanitization of the 'slug' attribute within the 'wpforo' shortcode to inject SQL code. Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the WordPress database. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.4.
