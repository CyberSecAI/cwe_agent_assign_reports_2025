  "description": "FastAPI Guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control IPs, log requests, and detect penetration attempts. An **HTTP header injection** vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-46814\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the FastAPI application's handling of the X-Forwarded-For header. The application directly trusts this header without validation, allowing manipulation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Remote Header Injection via X-Forwarded-For Manipulation.\n*   Lack of validation of the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Attackers can bypass IP-based access controls.\n*   Attackers can mislead logging systems.\n*   Attackers can impersonate trusted clients.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header in HTTP requests.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker can send crafted HTTP requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding secure client IP extraction with trusted proxy validation.\n*   New configuration parameters were added for proxy security:\n    *   `trusted_proxies`: List of trusted proxy IPs or CIDR ranges.\n    *   `trusted_proxy_depth`: Configurable proxy chain depth.\n    *   `trust_x_forwarded_proto`: Option to trust X-Forwarded-Proto header.\n*   The patched version is 2.0.0.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The fix involves validating the X-Forwarded-For header against a list of trusted proxies and considering the proxy chain depth.\n*   The documentation provides an example of how to configure trusted proxies.\n*   The `extract_client_ip` function securely extracts the client IP address, considering trusted proxies.\n*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 3.4 (Low).\n*   The vulnerability was reported by amooryx.\n*   The fix is included in commit `0b003fd`.\n*   The fix is part of pull request #43.\n*   The IPInfoManager is only initialized when country filtering is enabled.\n*   The documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.",

The authorization CWEs are higher level Classes. The hierarchical relationships guided the selection of the more specific CWE-113.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe285, cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **improper input validation** (specifically, **lack of validation** of the X-Forwarded-For header). This leads to **HTTP header injection** (CWE-113), which then allows attackers to bypass IP-based access controls (CWE-285/863) and impersonate trusted clients.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **HTTP header injection** vulnerability through manipulation of the X-Forwarded-For header. The selection of CWE-113 is based on the vulnerability description that an attacker can inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-113, which involves **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, suggesting authorization issues (CWE-285/863), but the root cause is the **improper handling** of the HTTP header. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the lack of validation of the X-Forwarded-For header. Therefore, CWE-113 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is based on direct evidence of **header injection**. The retriever results also listed CWE-113 as a good candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1749.57\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1706.47\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.

This directly corresponds to the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers. The security implication is that attackers can bypass IP-based access controls and impersonate trusted clients.

The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the usage of CWE-113 at the Variant level.\n\n**Technical Explanation for CWE-285:**\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a possible secondary weakness, as the **HTTP header injection** leads to bypassing IP-based access controls. However, it's a higher-level Class, and the root cause is the **improper handling** of the HTTP header.\n\n**Technical Explanation for CWE-863:**\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is another possible secondary weakness, similar to CWE-285, but it implies that there is some authorization mechanism that is incorrectly implemented.\n\nCWE-74, CWE-79, and CWE-93 were considered but deemed less appropriate. CWE-74 is too general, and more specific CWEs are available. CWE-79 relates to Cross-Site Scripting, which is not the primary issue here. While CWE-93 is a parent of CWE-113, the description for CWE-113 more accurately describes the vulnerability.",
