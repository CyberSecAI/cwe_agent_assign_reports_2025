## Vulnerability Description
Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to arbitrary file read in train.pys `export_pth` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind **server-side request forgery** to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **server-side request forgery**
- **impact:** read arbitrary files and arbitrary file read
- **product:** Applio
- **version:** 3.2.8-bugfix and prior
- **component:** train.pys `export_pth` function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the `export_pth` function in `train.py` which takes user-supplied input (`pth_dropdown_export`) without proper sanitization or validation. The function then passes this input to the `export_pth` function, which checks if the file exists and returns the path to the user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Arbitrary file read.

Impact of exploitation:
- Reading arbitrary files on the applio server.

Attack vectors:
- Exploitation occurs when the user provides a malicious file path through the `pth_dropdown_export`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attacker needs to provide a path to a file on the server.
