  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to arbitrary file read in train.pys `export_pth` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind **server-side request forgery** to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

The function then passes this input to the `export_pth` function, which checks if the file exists and returns the path to the user.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Arbitrary file read.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Reading arbitrary files on the applio server.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Exploitation occurs when the user provides a malicious file path through the `pth_dropdown_export`.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Attacker needs to provide a path to a file on the server.\n\n```",

CWE-22 is also a Base level CWE and a peer of CWE-918. There are no direct parent-child relationships between the selected CWEs, but they can be related in a vulnerability chain. The analysis focuses on identifying the root cause, which is the **server-side request forgery**, rather than just the file read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **server-side request forgery** (CWE-918) in the `export_pth` function, which allows an attacker to control the path used by the server. This can lead to arbitrary file reads on the server (impact). If the server has access to an internal network, the **server-side request forgery** can be used to read files from other servers in the internal network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, especially the \"**weakness:** **server-side request forgery**\" phrase and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which indicates that the vulnerability is caused by the `export_pth` function taking user-supplied input without proper sanitization. The root cause is clearly identified as **server-side request forgery** (CWE-918), leading to the impact of reading arbitrary files. CWE-918 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nThe `export_pth` function in `train.py` takes user-supplied input (`pth_dropdown_export`) without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious file path.\n\nThe selection of CWE-918 is based on the clear indication of **server-side request forgery** in the vulnerability description. While arbitrary file read is an impact, the root cause is the **server-side request forgery** allowing the attacker to control the request made by the server.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
