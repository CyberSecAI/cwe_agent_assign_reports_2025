This allows a remote user to send a crafted packet that overflows the buffer.\n*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.\n*   **Impact:** Process crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted ORF\\_TOKEN message with a large `rtr_list_entries` value.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the Corosync cluster. This likely requires network access to the cluster.\n*   **Mitigation/Fix:** Not explicitly mentioned in this content.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe content describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Corosync Cluster Engine, specifically within the `orf_token_endian_convert` function, caused by a lack of size validation. This vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service (process crash) or potential arbitrary code execution. The attack involves sending a crafted ORF\\_TOKEN message with a maliciously large `rtr_list_entries` value.",

CWE-120 is also a child of CWE-119 and can precede CWE-416. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a stack-based buffer overflow, making CWE-121 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** in `orf_token_endian_convert` due to a large UDP packet. This leads to a potential process crash or arbitrary code execution. The root cause is the **lack of input validation** on the size of the UDP packet, allowing it to exceed the buffer's capacity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link summary, which clearly points to a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to a large UDP packet. The **root cause** is the **failure to validate the size of the input**. CWE-121 is the most specific CWE that accurately captures the nature of this vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the weakness as a \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the `orf_token_endian_convert` function. The CVE reference link summary further confirms this, stating that the function fails to properly check the size of `orf_token->rtr_list_entries` against the size of the `token_convert` buffer.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the \"stack-based\" nature of the overflow. While CWE-119 is a parent class, it is too general. CWE-120 could also be considered, but it doesn't explicitly state \"stack-based\", making CWE-121 a more precise fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
