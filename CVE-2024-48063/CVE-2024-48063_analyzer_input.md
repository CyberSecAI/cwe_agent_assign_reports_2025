# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48063

## Vulnerability Description
In PyTorch <=2.4.1, the RemoteModule has Deserialization RCE. NOTE this is disputed by multiple parties because this is intended behavior in PyTorch distributed computing.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**
- **impact:** RCE and remote code execution
- **product:** PyTorch
- **version:** <= 2.4.1
- **component:** RemoteModule

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `rpc.remote` function within PyTorch's distributed RPC framework. This function is susceptible to serialization attacks, which can lead to command injection and remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77):**  The core weakness is the ability to inject malicious commands into the RPC framework via crafted payloads.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of data being deserialized when using `rpc.remote`. This enables attackers to send malicious serialized data that can be executed when deserialized on the receiving end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected nodes within a distributed system.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker gains control over the targeted system with the privileges of the user running the PyTorch application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** Attackers can exploit the `rpc.remote` function over the network, sending malicious payloads to vulnerable nodes.
- **Malicious Payloads:** The attack is facilitated by crafting and delivering malicious serialized data to the vulnerable `rpc.remote` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the PyTorch distributed system to send malicious RPC requests.
- **Understanding of PyTorch RPC:** The attacker needs to understand how the `rpc.remote` function and the underlying serialization mechanisms work to craft a successful attack.
- **Ability to Send RPC Requests:**  The attacker needs the capability to send data to the PyTorch distributed RPC framework.
