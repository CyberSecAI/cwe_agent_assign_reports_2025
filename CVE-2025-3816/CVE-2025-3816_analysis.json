  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-3816: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content details a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in CicadasCms\\_v2.0. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate scheduled tasks within the CicadasCms application. Specifically, by adding a scheduled task with a crafted `beanClass` and `methodName`, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the ability to clear the Spring application context, preventing normal function execution and potentially allowing for more control.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the server.\n*   **Insecure Deserialization (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the use of `beanClass` and `methodName` suggests a potential for insecure deserialization if the application doesn't properly validate the input.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate the `beanClass` and `methodName` parameters when creating scheduled tasks.\n*   **Spring Framework Vulnerability:** The ability to clear the Spring application context (`springContextHolder.clearHolder()`) is exploited to disrupt normal application behavior.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to:\n\n*   Execute arbitrary code on the server.\n*   Potentially gain full control of the server.\n*   Disrupt the normal operation of the application.\n*   Potentially compromise sensitive data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  **Scheduled Task Creation:** An attacker can create a new scheduled task via the \"\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406 -> \u8ba1\u5212\u4efb\u52a1 -> \u6dfb\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\" (System Management -> Scheduled Tasks -> Add Task) interface.\n2.  **Crafted Payload:** The attacker crafts a POST request to `/system/schedule/save` with specific parameters:\n    *   `beanClass`:  Set to a class like `com.zhiliao.component.druid.DataSourceConfiguration`.\n    *   `methodName`: Set to a method like `dataSource`.\n    *   `springBean`: Set to `dataSourceConfiguration`.\n3.  **Context Clearing:** A second scheduled task can be created to call `springContextHolder.clearHolder()`, effectively clearing the Spring application context.\n4.  **Exploitation:** After adding the tasks, the attacker triggers the scheduled task, leading to code execution.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create scheduled tasks, implying some level of authenticated access to the application.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CicadasCms application.\n*   **Understanding of Spring Framework:** Knowledge of the Spring Framework and its components (like `ApplicationContext`) is helpful for crafting the exploit.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all parameters used in scheduled task creation, especially `beanClass` and `methodName`.  A whitelist of allowed classes and methods should be used.\n*   **Blacklisting/Whitelisting:** Implement a blacklist or whitelist of allowed execution types for scheduled tasks.\n*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific examples of the HTTP request payload, screenshots of the vulnerable interface, and a detailed explanation of the attack steps. It also explains the impact of clearing the Spring application context.",

The vulnerability description mentions \"os command injection\" directly, which makes CWE-78 the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-77 is a more general class of command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the input used in the scheduled task handler, leading to **OS command injection**. The attacker crafts a payload that is then executed by the system, resulting in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-78 due to the explicit mention of \"os command injection\". The provided evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary provides a strong basis for this classification. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-77, making it the optimal choice.\n\nThe selection is based on:\n- The vulnerability description mentions \"os command injection\".\n- The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions the root cause is the ability to manipulate scheduled tasks via crafted `beanClass` and `methodName` parameters.\n- The retriever results give a high score to CWE-78.\n\nCWE-77 was considered as a broader category, but CWE-78 is a more precise fit.
