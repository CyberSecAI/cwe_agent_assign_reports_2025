  "description": "The Anonymous Restricted Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.5 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to logged-in users.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the way the Anonymous Restricted Content plugin handles content restrictions in conjunction with the WordPress core search feature. The plugin failed to properly prevent unauthenticated users from accessing restricted content when using the search functionality.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that the plugin's content restriction mechanisms could be bypassed by using the WordPress search feature. This allowed unauthenticated users to access content intended only for logged-in users.\n- **Insufficient Filtering in Search Queries:** The plugin did not properly filter search results to exclude restricted content, thus exposing it to unauthorized access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Unauthenticated attackers could gain access to sensitive data within posts that were intended to be restricted to logged-in users. This could potentially include private information, confidential data, or other content that should not be publicly visible.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **WordPress Core Search Functionality:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by using the WordPress search feature to query for restricted content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be a logged-in user or have any special privileges on the WordPress site. They only require the ability to perform a search.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.6.5.\n- The fix was implemented in version 1.6.6.\n- The fix includes changes to how queries are handled, specifically by adding meta query checks to ensure that restricted content is not included in the search results, as well as excluding restricted categories.\n- The fix also modifies the REST API filtering to prevent access to restricted content for unauthenticated users.\n- The `hide_restricted_in_main_query` function in `class-arc-public.php` was changed to properly exclude restricted posts and categories when the user is not logged in.\n- The fix replaces the `rest_pre_echo_response` filter with `rest_request_before_callbacks` in `class-arc.php` to handle REST API content restrictions.",

This is the root cause as sensitive data intended to be restricted is exposed. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review. Authorization is missing, leading to exposure. A more specific CWE may be more appropriate. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is that of cause and effect. The **missing authorization** (CWE-862) leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). CWE-200 is chosen as the primary because it directly reflects the vulnerability's impact. CWE-862 is a contributing factor and is included as a secondary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe200 <--|CAUSED BY| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** leading to **sensitive information exposure**.\n- **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) in the plugin's handling of the WordPress core search feature.\n- **Weakness:** Failure to properly filter search results for restricted content.\n- **Impact:** **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200) to unauthenticated attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly indicate that the plugin failed to properly restrict access to content via the WordPress search feature, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-200, directly reflects the impact of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors. The secondary CWE, CWE-862, represents the underlying cause, which is the **missing authorization** check.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment includes:\n- \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to logged-in users.\"\n- \"The plugin failed to properly prevent unauthenticated users from accessing restricted content when using the search functionality.\"\n- \"The plugin did not properly filter search results to exclude restricted content, thus exposing it to unauthorized access.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 and CWE-862 is based on the evidence provided and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly describes the vulnerability's impact. CWE-862 is selected as a secondary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected*: This is not a CSRF vulnerability.
