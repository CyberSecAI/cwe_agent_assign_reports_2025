  "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to poll an affected device using SNMP, even if the device is configured to deny SNMP traffic from an unauthorized source or the SNMPv3 username is removed from the configuration. This vulnerability exists because of **the way that the SNMPv3 configuration is stored** in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software startup configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by polling an affected device from a source address that should have been denied. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations from a source that should be denied. Note The attacker has no control of the SNMPv3 configuration. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid SNMPv3 user credentials. For more information, see the section of this advisory.",

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to the way the SNMPv3 configuration is stored in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software startup configuration. Specifically, the conversion of authentication and privacy protocol strings to fixed-length octets, along with the addition of the \"encrypted\" keyword, can dramatically increase the configuration line length.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Configuration truncation: If the resulting configuration line exceeds 255 characters, it may be truncated when read back into the running configuration after a device reload.\n*   Missing ACL enforcement: This truncation can lead to the ACL (Access Control List) not being applied to the SNMPv3 user, effectively removing access restrictions.\n*   CWE-16: Configuration\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn authenticated, remote attacker can poll an affected device using SNMP, even if the device is configured to deny SNMP traffic from unauthorized sources or the SNMPv3 username is removed from the configuration. This allows the attacker to perform SNMP operations from a source that should be denied.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote attack via SNMP polling.\n*   Requires valid SNMPv3 user credentials.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated attacker (valid SNMPv3 credentials).\n*   Ability to send SNMP polls to the affected device.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Workarounds:**\n    *   Move the IPv4/IPv6 ACL name to be attached to the SNMPv3 group name instead of the username.\n    *   Shorten the combination of user, group, and ACL names.\n*   **Fixed Software:**\n    *   Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Software releases 17.15.3 or 17.17.1 and reconfigure SNMPv3 using type 6 encryption.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   Base Score: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The advisory includes examples of affected and corrected configurations.\n*   It details the character length increases caused by different authentication and privacy protocols.\n*   It specifies that Cisco does not plan to release a fix specifically for this vulnerability but provides a configuration change as a workaround.\n*   It lists related Cisco Bug IDs: CSCwi84832 and CSCwk87338.\n*   It clarifies that the vulnerability does *not* affect IOS XR Software, Meraki products, or NX-OS Software.",

CWE-863 and CWE-20 were also considered, but ultimately, CWE-16 best describes the **root cause** due to the misconfiguration. The relationships show that CWE-16 can lead to other vulnerabilities such as improper authorization (CWE-863) or input validation issues (CWE-20).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe16[\"CWE-16: Configuration\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe16 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n    cwe16 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe16 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration** (CWE-16) of the SNMPv3 settings. This leads to an **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), where an attacker from a denied source is able to perform SNMP operations. The **improper input validation** (CWE-20) stems from the configuration being truncated, indirectly validating the source.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards configuration issues and access control problems. After reviewing the detailed explanation in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", the vulnerability is primarily due to **how the SNMPv3 configuration is stored**, leading to truncation and **missing ACL enforcement**. This is best represented by CWE-16. The retriever results also suggest related CWEs like CWE-863 and CWE-20, which represent the downstream effects of the configuration error. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-16 is a Class-level CWE that encapsulates the general configuration issue, while the others are more specific effects of the misconfiguration. The evidence to support this is \"The vulnerability exists because of **the way that the SNMPv3 configuration is stored** in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software startup configuration\" and \"If the resulting configuration line exceeds 255 characters, it may be truncated when read back into the running configuration after a device reload. This truncation can lead to the ACL (Access Control List) not being applied to the SNMPv3 user, effectively removing access restrictions.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
