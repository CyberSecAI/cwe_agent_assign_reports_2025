|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified CWE, CWE-290, stands as a Base level weakness related to authentication bypass. While several other CWEs were considered, none provided a more precise fit given the limited information. The hierarchical relationships were examined to ensure that a more specific child CWE of CWE-290 wasn't a better fit, but the evidence did not support that.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain appears to be limited based on the provided information. The root cause is a **spoofing vulnerability** which leads to the disclosure of NTLM hashes.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The provided information is limited, pointing primarily to a **"Spoofing Vulnerability"** that results in NTLM hash disclosure. Given this, CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) appears to be the most relevant.

The retriever results suggested several other CWEs, including CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch), CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature). However, these CWEs require more specific technical details that are not available in the vulnerability description.

The decision to select CWE-290 is based on the direct statement that this is a **"Spoofing Vulnerability"**, which aligns well with the description of CWE-290 as an incorrectly implemented authentication scheme subject to spoofing attacks.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** This CWE is related to certificate validation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used:** There is no mention of weak credentials in the description.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** The vulnerability description does not specify a capture-replay attack.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** While the vulnerability results in NTLM hash disclosure, the **weakness** itself isn't explicitly tied to the use of a weak hash algorithm.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** There is no indication that the vulnerability involves assumed-immutable data.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used:** This CWE is related to random number generation, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Used:** The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **"Spoofing Vulnerability"**, which aligns with the description of this CWE.

## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** This CWE is related to alternate names during authentication, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** This CWE involves input validation issues, which are not explicit in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used:** This CWE is related to observable response discrepancies, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 317.64
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not implement or incorrectly implements one or more security-relevant checks as specified by the design of a standardized algorithm, protocol, or technique.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes
