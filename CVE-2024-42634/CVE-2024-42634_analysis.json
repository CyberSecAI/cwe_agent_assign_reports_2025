The lack of input sanitization on the \"mac\" parameter allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute OS commands with root privileges on the router.\n- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint via the web interface. The malicious payload is placed inside the \"mac\" parameter.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the web interface.",

It is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')), which is a Class. CWE-78 can follow CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs). CWE-250 is included because the commands are being run with root privileges.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe184,cwe250 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** on the \"mac\" parameter in the `formWriteFacMac` function. This leads to **OS command injection** because the unsanitized input is passed to the `doSystemCmd` function. Finally, the injected commands are executed with root privileges, granting the attacker control over the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the clear evidence of OS command injection. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary both explicitly mention command injection, and the root cause is directly attributed to the lack of input sanitization. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-250 is included as a secondary weakness since the attacker is able to execute OS commands with root privileges.\n\nCWE-77 was considered, but CWE-78 is more specific. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was also considered, as the root cause is a **lack of input validation**, but it is too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
