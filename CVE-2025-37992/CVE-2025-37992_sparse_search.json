  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched Flush gso_skb list too during ->change() Previously, when reducing a qdiscs limit via the ->change() operation, only the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check sch->limit against sch->q.qlen. This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming excess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie) are updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.",
