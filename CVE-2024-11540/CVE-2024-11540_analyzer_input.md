# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11540

## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24700.

- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during DXF file parsing, resulting in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read.
- Improper input validation of DXF file data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking the target user into opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the parsing of a specially crafted DXF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the target or lure them to a malicious web page.
- User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
