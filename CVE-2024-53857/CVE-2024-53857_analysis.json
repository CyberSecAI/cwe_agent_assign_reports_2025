CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a Variant of CWE-770 and was also considered because the vulnerability involves memory allocation with large size values. However, CWE-770 is a more general case that includes other types of resource allocation and is therefore a better fit as the primary CWE. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a parent Class of CWE-770, but it's less specific and the mapping guidance discourages its use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of OpenPGP packets**, specifically the **lack of limits or throttling on resource allocation**. This leads to **excessive memory allocation**, which in turn causes **resource exhaustion** and a **denial of service**.\n- Root Cause: **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)**\n- Resulting Weakness: **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)**\n- Impact: Resource exhaustion, Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **uncontrolled allocation of resources** when parsing OpenPGP packets. The **root cause** is the **lack of limits or throttling on resource allocation (CWE-770)**. The evidence includes:\n- \"Insufficient upper limits on the total reserved amount of memory when parsing long sequences of partial OpenPGP packets.\"\n- \"Excessive memory allocation for fixed-size OpenPGP packets with large length fields, even if less data is received.\"\n- \"Lack of restrictions on Argon2 parameters within the `Symmetric Key Encrypted Session Key` (SKESK) packet processing.\"\n\nCWE-770 accurately captures this **root cause**. CWE-789 is a more specific case related to memory allocation, and while relevant, it doesn't fully encompass the broader issue of resource allocation without limits. CWE-400 is too general and is discouraged for this type of vulnerability.\n\nThe hierarchical relationships influenced the selection by guiding the choice towards the most specific and relevant CWE. CWE-770 is at the Base level and accurately describes the weakness, making it a better choice than its parent Class CWE-400.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nrPGP is a pure Rust implementation of OpenPGP.
