# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39921

## Vulnerability Description
Observable **timing discrepancy** issue exists in IPCOM EX2 Series V01L02NF0001 to V01L06NF0401, V01L20NF0001 to V01L20NF0401, V02L20NF0001 to V02L21NF0301, and IPCOM VE2 Series V01L04NF0001 to V01L06NF0112. If this vulnerability is exploited, some of the encrypted communication may be decrypted by an attacker who can obtain the contents of the communication.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **timing discrepancy**
- **impact:** decrypt encrypted communication
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** IPCOM EX2 Series and IPCOM VE2 Series
- **version:** V01L02NF0001 to V01L06NF0401 and V01L20NF0001 to V01L20NF0401 and V02L20NF0001 to V02L21NF0301 and V01L04NF0001 to V01L06NF0112

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a timing discrepancy in the processing of SSL/TLS connections within the IPCOM product's SSL accelerator/SSL-VPN functionality. Specifically, differences in processing time based on certain parameters can be observed by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Timing Side-Channel:** The core vulnerability is a timing side-channel (CWE-208). Observable differences in processing time during cryptographic operations leak information. This timing difference depends on whether the RSA key exchange cipher suite is used or not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who can capture the encrypted communication and observe the timing of the responses can potentially decrypt a portion of the communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based; the attacker needs to be able to send requests and receive responses from the affected IPCOM device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor and intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable IPCOM device.
- **Passive Monitoring:** The attacker needs to be able to observe the timing of the responses from the server.
- **Cipher Suite Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know that the server is using the vulnerable RSA key exchange cipher suite.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects various versions of IPCOM EX2 and VE2 series products.
- **Affected Protocols:** TLS 1.2 and lower protocols are vulnerable if RSA key exchange cipher suites are enabled.
- **Workaround:** Disabling RSA key exchange cipher suites mitigates the vulnerability.
- **Solution:** Updating to the patched firmware versions provided by Fsas Technologies Inc. resolves the vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** The JPCERT/CC analysis provides a CVSS v3 base score of 5.9, with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicating a network-based attack with high complexity, no required privileges or user interaction and a high impact on confidentiality but no impact on integrity or availability.
- **Vendor Disclosure:** Fsas Technologies Inc. reported this vulnerability to JPCERT/CC.
