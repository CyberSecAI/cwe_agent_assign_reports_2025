  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used. The issue arises from **improper sanitization** in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, ``, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization within the `response.links` function of the Express framework. This function is used to set the `Link` header in HTTP responses. When unsanitized user-provided data is used as part of the `Link` header values, it allows for resource injection. The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject characters like `*`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This is particularly problematic when dealing with dynamic parameters.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   **Resource Injection:** The core vulnerability is a resource injection, as the application uses unsanitized input to construct resource identifiers, leading to unintended resource loading.\n    *   **Improper Sanitization:** The failure to sanitize user-provided data before incorporating it into the `Link` header is the direct cause.\n    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate and restrict input before using it in the header.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:\n    *   **Preload Malicious Resources:** By injecting specially crafted URLs into the `Link` header, an attacker can cause a client's browser to preload malicious resources, such as JavaScript files, stylesheets, or other content from attacker-controlled servers.\n    *   **Possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly stated as a direct XSS vulnerability, the ability to preload resources can potentially lead to XSS if the attacker injects malicious JavaScript.\n    *   **Arbitrary Resource Loading:** The attacker gains control over resources loaded by the client, potentially impacting the user experience and compromising security.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **HTTP Query Parameters:** The example shows the vulnerability being exploited via manipulating HTTP query parameters, where the `resource` parameter is used to inject the malicious URLs.\n    *   **Dynamic Parameters:** The vulnerability is highlighted to be especially relevant in cases where the data is dynamic and user-provided, making it easier to inject malicious payloads.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with the malicious payload in the query parameters.\n    *   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The provided example doesn't mention any authentication requirements, suggesting that the vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate first.\n    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know the application uses the vulnerable `res.links` function and how to manipulate it.\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** Express versions `3.0.0-alpha1` up to and including `3.21.2` are affected.\n\n*  **Mitigation:**\n   * Migrate away from Express 3\n   * Use a commercial support partner like HeroDevs for post-EOL security support.\n\n* **Additional Notes:**\n    * The vulnerability is in Express version 3 which has reached End-of-Life.\n    *  HeroDevs offers a patched version of Express 3 in their \"Never-Ending Support\" program, which fixes this issue.\n    * A proof of concept is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.",

CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') were considered as potential secondary CWEs due to the possibility of XSS and general injection vulnerabilities, respectively.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions that the application \"does not adequately validate and restrict input before using it in the header.\" This directly aligns with CWE-113, which focuses on the **improper neutralization** of CR and LF characters in HTTP headers.\n\nCWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), was considered as a secondary CWE because the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions the possibility of XSS due to the ability to preload resources. However, this is a potential impact rather than the root cause.\n\nCWE-74, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'), was also considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves resource injection. However, CWE-74 is a more general CWE, and CWE-113 is more specific to the context of HTTP headers.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 as the primary CWE is based on its direct alignment with the **improper sanitization** of input in HTTP headers, as described in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The graph relationships influenced this decision by highlighting the connections between input validation, HTTP header manipulation, and potential injection vulnerabilities. CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness in the context of HTTP headers, whereas other CWEs are either more general or represent potential impacts.",
