  "query": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used. The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, ``, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.",
