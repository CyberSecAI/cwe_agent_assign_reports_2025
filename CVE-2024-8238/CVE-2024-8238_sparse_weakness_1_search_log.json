  "query": "In version 3.22.0 of aimhubio/aim, the AimQL query language uses an outdated version of the safer_getattr() function from RestrictedPython. This version does not protect against the str.format_map() method, allowing an attacker to leak server-side secrets or potentially gain unrestricted code execution. The vulnerability arises because str.format_map() can read arbitrary attributes of Python objects, enabling attackers to access sensitive variables such as os.environ. If an attacker can write files to a known location on the Aim server, they can use str.format_map() to load a malicious .dll/.so file into the Python interpreter, leading to unrestricted code execution.",
