  "description": "In version 3.22.0 of aimhubio/aim, the AimQL query language uses an outdated version of the safer_getattr() function from RestrictedPython. This version does not protect against the str.format_map() method, allowing an attacker to leak server-side secrets or potentially gain unrestricted code execution. The vulnerability arises because **str.format_map() can read arbitrary attributes of Python objects**, enabling attackers to access sensitive variables such as os.environ. If an attacker can write files to a known location on the Aim server, they can use str.format_map() to load a malicious .dll/.so file into the Python interpreter, leading to unrestricted code execution.",

CWE-1336, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine, is a child of CWE-94 and peer of CWE-1336, providing a more specific view of the weakness but is not chosen as the primary. The relationship between these CWEs indicates a potential chain of events where improper neutralization leads to code injection. Abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the base level for root cause identification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -- PEEROF -- cwe1336\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **outdated version of safer_getattr() function** which leads to the **weakness** that **str.format_map() can read arbitrary attributes of Python objects**, then potentially leading to unrestricted code execution.\n  - Root Cause: Outdated safer_getattr() leading to arbitrary attribute access.\n  - Weakness: str.format_map() allows reading arbitrary attributes.\n  - Impact: Potential for server-side secret leakage and unrestricted code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its potential impact. The primary CWE, CWE-94, aligns well with the unrestricted code execution aspect, stemming from the **improper control of code generation** through the exploitation of `str.format_map()`. The selection is heavily based on the vulnerability description indicating the potential for unrestricted code execution.\n\nThe relationship analysis helped refine the selection, particularly the child relationship of CWE-1336 to CWE-94.
