# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-25675

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is a **command injection** in the formexeCommand function where the str variable receives the cmdinput parameter from a POST request and is later assigned to the cmd_buf variable, which is directly used in the doSystemCmd function, causing an arbitrary command execution. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base level CWE.
- CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Class) and CWE-74 (Class).
- CWE-78 has peer relationships with CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine).
- The hierarchical relationships and peer relationships did not influence the selection of the primary CWE because CWE-78 directly addresses the **OS Command Injection** vulnerability described.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the OS command (CWE-78), which leads to arbitrary command execution.
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **command injection** in the formexeCommand function where the str variable receives the cmdinput parameter from a POST request and is later assigned to the cmd_buf variable, which is directly used in the doSystemCmd function, causing an arbitrary command execution. The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.

The retriever results also pointed to CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') as a top candidate. However, since the command is specifically an OS command, CWE-78 is a better fit.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.
