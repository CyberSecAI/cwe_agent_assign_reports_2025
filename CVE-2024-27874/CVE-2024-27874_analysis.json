The vulnerability results in a denial-of-service, implying resource exhaustion. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE. DoS is caused by uncontrolled consumption of resources. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770, with CWE-770 being a more specific type of CWE-400. The description mentions denial-of-service, which indicates a resource consumption issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation (CWE-770), leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), and ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service. While the description lacks specific technical details, the fact that a remote attacker can cause a DoS suggests a resource management issue. CWE-770, \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling,\" aligns well with this scenario, as it describes a situation where resources are allocated without proper control, leading to potential exhaustion. CWE-400, \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption,\" is a more general case of a DoS.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, making it a more specific and appropriate choice for this vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence is based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", stating the impact of exploitation is a remote denial-of-service (DoS). The statement, \"This issue was addressed through improved state management\" indirectly supports this since state management issues can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 directly addresses the allocation of resources without limits, which is a common cause of denial-of-service vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected* because the description does not indicate that the vulnerability leaks any information.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
