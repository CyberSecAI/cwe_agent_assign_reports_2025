# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41957

## Vulnerability Description
Vim is an open source command line text editor. Vim < v9.1.0647 has **double free** in src/alloc.c616. When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a double-free/use-after-free access exception. Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags, but it may cause a crash of Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a double-free/use-after-free error. It arises from how Vim handles tagstack data when closing a window. Specifically, when a window is closed, the tagstack data associated with that window is cleared and freed. Later, the quickfix list, which may point to the same tagstack data, is also cleared. This results in an attempt to free already freed memory, causing a double-free or use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free (CWE-415):** The core issue is the attempt to free the same memory region twice. The tagstack data is freed during the window closing process, but the quickfix list cleanup might trigger a second free on the same memory.
*   **Use-After-Free:** When the memory is freed, the quickfix list might still hold a pointer to the now invalid memory region, leading to a use-after-free scenario if accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can cause a crash of the Vim application due to the double-free or use-after-free condition. This would result in a denial of service for the user of Vim.
*   **Potential for other impacts:** The NetApp advisory indicates that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or modification of data, but this is not elaborated further.

**Attack Vectors:**

The vulnerability can be triggered by closing a window in Vim that has tagstack data, and where the quickfix list points to the same tagstack data. This can happen under certain conditions when the user runs Vim with non-default flags that cause a quickfix list to reference the same tagstack data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute Vim on the target system or provide the input to cause the crash.
*   **Specific Vim Flags/Configuration:** The attacker must use specific, non-default Vim command-line flags or configurations to trigger the vulnerability.  The provided PoC uses  `-u NONE -X -Z -e -s -S double_free -c ':qa!'` options to reproduce the issue.
*   **User interaction:** User interaction is required to open and close windows in a specific manner.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered low severity in the context of the original report, as it requires intentional use of specific, non-default flags.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Vim patch v9.1.0647.
*   The fix addresses the issue by using `tagstack_clear_entry()`, which now uses the `VIM_CLEAR` macro to prevent the double free by setting pointers to NULL after freeing the memory.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the steps to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue was reported by GitHub user SuyueGuo.
*   NetApp's advisory indicates that several of their products incorporate Vim, and some of them are under investigation for this vulnerability. However, they report no products that are affected at this time.
*   The CVSS score provided on Github is 4.5 with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L while NetApp gives the score of 5.3 with CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L.
