# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-35003
## Query
Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer and Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache NuttX RTOS Bluetooth Stack (HCI and UART components) that may result in system crash, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution, after receiving maliciously crafted packets. NuttXs Bluetooth HCI/UART stack users are advised to upgrade to version 12.9.0, which fixes the identified implementation issues. This issue affects Apache NuttX from 7.25 before 12.9.0.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer', 'Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities'
- **weakness**: 'stack-based buffer overflow'
