  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-32067 Analysis\n\nThe provided content relates to CVE-2025-32067. Here's an extraction of relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is an i18n XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue discovered with `$wgUseXssLanguage`. It was found during testing using the `uselang=x-xss` parameter with Special:Homepage.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **XSS:** The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting flaw.\n*   **i18n issue:** The XSS is related to internationalization (i18n) features.\n*   **Improper output encoding/escaping:** The description suggests that the issue stems from how messages are parsed, specifically the description field. Only the description is parsed using `$( '<p>' ).html()`, while other message keys are displayed using `text()`, which provides escaping.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is not explicitly stated, but XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Visiting `Special:Homepage` with the `uselang=x-xss` parameter.\n*   The vulnerability exists in `growthexperiments-homepage-suggestededits-tasktype-description-*`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to control the `uselang` parameter in the URL.\n*   No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   A patch (F58441954: T386963.patch) has been created and applied.\n*   The fix adjusts the method used to parse the description to prevent XSS.\n*   The patch was merged into the `master` branch of the `mediawiki/extensions/GrowthExperiments` repository (Change #1122163).\n*   The fix was deployed to production on February 24, 2025.\n*   The task was closed as resolved.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was initially discovered using a tool/methodology described in T340201 (\"Use custom language code to find i18n XSS issues\").\n*   A related issue was identified in VisualEditor, but it's unclear if it's a security concern.\n*   There was discussion about potentially moving all escaping to a single location (server-side or client-side) for better maintainability.\n*   The risk rating was assessed as Medium.\n*   The patch was backported and published.",

CWE-79 is a specific type of weakness that arises when input validation is insufficient. While other CWEs like CWE-80 and CWE-116 are related to XSS, CWE-79 directly addresses the core issue of failing to neutralize input before generating the web page. The abstraction levels of Base for both CWE-79 and CWE-20 are appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), which allows malicious input to be processed. This leads to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** (CWE-79), where the unvalidated input is used to generate a web page without proper sanitization, resulting in XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified both **Improper Input Validation** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** as key elements. The description explicitly mentions **\"Improper Input Validation vulnerability\"** and **\"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\"**. The retriever results consistently highlighted CWE-79 and CWE-20 as relevant. The final decision is based on these key phrases.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights that insufficient input validation (CWE-20) often precedes XSS (CWE-79).\n\nCWE-79 is selected as the primary CWE because the description clearly states that the vulnerability allows Cross-Site Scripting due to **Improper Input Validation**. This aligns with the core definition of CWE-79, which involves failing to neutralize user-controllable input before using it in a web page. CWE-20 is added as a secondary CWE, as it describes the **root cause** of the XSS vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2550.60\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
