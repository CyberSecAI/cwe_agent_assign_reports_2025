# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-25075

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which allows an attacker to induce unintended actions on a web application when a user is authenticated. The Stored XSS, CWE-79, arises because the application fails to properly neutralize input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and executed in the admin area. The CSRF can lead to the injection of malicious scripts, so CWE-352 can precede CWE-79. Both are Base level abstractions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, where an attacker crafts a malicious request. If successful, this leads to CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), because the forged request injects malicious scripts into the system, which are then stored and executed in the admin area.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability involves two distinct weaknesses: CSRF and Stored XSS. The description clearly states "**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability in Venugopal Show notice or message on admin area allows **Stored XSS**". This indicates that a successful CSRF attack leads to the ability to inject and store XSS payloads.

CWE-352 is selected as the primary weakness because the description highlights it as the initial vulnerability. The subsequent Stored XSS (CWE-79) is a direct consequence of the CSRF, where the forged request injects malicious scripts.

Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base and Compound), as they accurately represent the individual weaknesses and their relationship.

The retriever results and graph-based relationships support this mapping. CWE-79 and CWE-352 are highly ranked, indicating their relevance to the vulnerability description. The relationship analysis shows that CSRF can lead to XSS, which aligns with the vulnerability's progression.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Stored XSS**, and this is more related to reflected XSS*

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is a good fit as a secondary weakness, because the vulnerability description states **Stored XSS***

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*This is a good fit as a primary weakness, because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is not the best fit because the vulnerability description states **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)***

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
