  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-21809', description='In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rxrpc, afs Fix peer hash locking vs RCU callback In its address list, afs now retains pointers to and refs on one or more rxrpc_peer objects. The address list is freed under RCU and at this time, it puts the refs on those peers. Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock. However, it is now being called from afss RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock. The put may also be called from non-BH context, and so there exists the possibility of deadlock if the BH-based RCU cleanup happens whilst the hash spinlock is held. This led to the attached lockdep complaint. Fix this by changing spinlocks of rxnet->peer_hash_lock back to BH-disabling locks. ================================ WARNING inconsistent lock state 6.13.0-rc5-build2+ #1223 Tainted G E -------------------------------- inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} -> {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} usage. swapper/1/0 [HC0[0]SC1[1]HE1SE0] takes ffff88810babe228 (&rxnet->peer_hash_lock){+.?.}-{33}, at rxrpc_put_peer+0xcb/0x180 {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} state was registered at mark_usage+0x164/0x180 __lock_acquire+0x544/0x990 lock_acquire.part.0+0x103/0x280 _raw_spin_lock+0x2f/0x40 rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker+0x144/0x440 process_one_work+0x486/0x7c0 process_scheduled_works+0x73/0x90 worker_thread+0x1c8/0x2a0 kthread+0x19b/0x1b0 ret_from_fork+0x24/0x40 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 irq event stamp 972402 hardirqs last enabled at (972402) [] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x2e/0x50 hardirqs last disabled at (972401) [] _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x18/0x60 softirqs last enabled at (972300) [] handle_softirqs+0x3ee/0x430 softirqs last disabled at (972313) [] __irq_exit_rcu+0x44/0x110 other info that might help us debug this Possible **unsafe locking scenario** CPU0 ---- lock(&rxnet->peer_hash_lock) lock(&rxnet->peer_hash_lock) *** DEADLOCK *** 1 lock held by swapper/1/0 #0 ffffffff83576be0 (rcu_callback){....}-{00}, at rcu_lock_acquire+0x7/0x30 stack backtrace CPU 1 UID 0 PID 0 Comm swapper/1 Tainted G E 6.13.0-rc5-build2+ #1223 Tainted [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE Hardware name ASUS All Series/H97-PLUS, BIOS 2306 10/09/2014 Call Trace dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x80 print_usage_bug.part.0+0x227/0x240 valid_state+0x53/0x70 mark_lock_irq+0xa5/0x2f0 mark_lock+0xf7/0x170 mark_usage+0xe1/0x180 __lock_acquire+0x544/0x990 lock_acquire.part.0+0x103/0x280 _raw_spin_lock+0x2f/0x40 rxrpc_put_peer+0xcb/0x180 afs_free_addrlist+0x46/0x90 [kafs] rcu_do_batch+0x2d2/0x640 rcu_core+0x2f7/0x350 handle_softirqs+0x1ee/0x430 __irq_exit_rcu+0x44/0x110 irq_exit_rcu+0xa/0x30 sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x7f/0xa0', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'unsafe locking scenario', 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'deadlock', 'vector': 'RCU callback', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '6.13.0-rc5-build2', 'component': 'rxrpc'}, reference_content='UNRELATED', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '667', 'name': 'Improper Locking', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(989.0273861250212)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '770', 'name': 'Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(939.4395336594)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '201', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(933.6071855693656)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1390', 'name': 'Weak Authentication', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(930.0941019037856)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '401', 'name': 'Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(927.2026985138612)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '833', 'name': 'Deadlock', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': 'The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.', 'keyphrase_source': 'rootcause:unsafe locking scenario', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2009-4017: Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2005-4650: CMS does not restrict the number of searches that can occur simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2020-15100: web application scanner attempts to read an excessively large file created by a user, causing process termination\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19463: An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-19464: An issue has been found in function XRef::fetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow .\n\n- CVE-2021-29324: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component /moddable/xs/sources/xsScript.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-29329: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute function at /moddable/xs/sources/xsTree.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-41800: MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time).

This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)\n\n- CVE-2021-22174: Crash in USB HID dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.2 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2020-22785: Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a missing lock check which could cause a denial of service.

Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust.

All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory.

Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-41167: modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-42262: An issue was discovered in Softing OPC UA C++ SDK before 5.70.

Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-3569: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to either immediately crash the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or make it consume available memory and eventually crash. The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device. These vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44988: Jerryscript v3.0.0 and below was discovered to contain a stack overflow via ecma_find_named_property in ecma-helpers.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-46050: A Stack Overflow vulnerability exists in Binaryen 103 via the printf_common function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29503: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the libpthread linuxthreads functionality of uClibC 0.9.33.2 and uClibC-ng 1.0.40.

Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-3759: A memory overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s ipc functionality of the memcg subsystem, in the way a user calls the semget function multiple times, creating semaphores. This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1708: A vulnerability was found in CRI-O that causes memory or disk space exhaustion on the node for anyone with access to the Kube API. The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

This issue affects: SUSE Manager Server 4.1 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.1.46. SUSE Manager Server 4.2 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.2.37. \n\n- CVE-2022-23487: js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce plugin <= 1.7.7 at WordPress leading to &yikes-the-content-toggle option update. \n\n- CVE-2021-36369: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php.

Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0).

For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions. Insufficient capability checks made it possible to fetch other users' calendar action events.\n\n- CVE-2021-31548: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. A MediaWiki user who is partially blocked or was unsuccessfully blocked could bypass AbuseFilter and have their edits completed.\n\n- CVE-2021-31552: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).\n\n- CVE-2020-36289: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the QueryComponentRendererValue!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1. In some cases, there is improper enforcement of the privilege requirement for viewing a list of tickets that shows title, state, etc.\n\n- CVE-2021-22134: A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface.

This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39322: @keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command.

The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy. Possibly related to improper permissions, large-window race condition.\n\n- CVE-2000-0338: Chain: predictable file names used for locking, allowing attacker to create the lock beforehand. Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05862986; Issue ID: ALPS05862986.\n\n- CVE-2022-21775: In sched driver, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06479032; Issue ID: ALPS06479032.\n\n- CVE-2022-26452: In isp, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07262305; Issue ID: ALPS07262305.\n\n- CVE-2022-26473: In vdec fmt, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07342197; Issue ID: ALPS07342197.\n\n- CVE-2022-32811: A memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2009-4017: Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2005-4650: CMS does not restrict the number of searches that can occur simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2020-15100: web application scanner attempts to read an excessively large file created by a user, causing process termination\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19463: An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-19464: An issue has been found in function XRef::fetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow .\n\n- CVE-2021-29324: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component /moddable/xs/sources/xsScript.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-29329: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute function at /moddable/xs/sources/xsTree.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-41800: MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time). Visiting Special:Contributions can sometimes result in a long running SQL query because PoolCounter protection is mishandled.\n\n- CVE-2021-35492: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.11+5 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata vhost parameter. This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)\n\n- CVE-2021-22174: Crash in USB HID dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.2 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2020-22785: Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a missing lock check which could cause a denial of service. Aggressively targeting random pad import endpoints with empty data would flatten all pads due to lack of rate limiting and missing ownership check.\n\n- CVE-2021-33831: api/account/register in the TH Wildau COVID-19 Contact Tracing application through 2021-09-01 has Incorrect Access Control. An attacker can interfere with tracing of infection chains by creating 500 random users within 2500 seconds.\n\n- CVE-2020-28200: The Sieve engine in Dovecot before 2.3.15 allows Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, as demonstrated by a situation with a complex regular expression for the regex extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-41591: ACINQ Eclair before 0.6.3 allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2021-41592: Blockstream c-lightning through 0.10.1 allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2021-41593: Lightning Labs lnd before 0.13.3-beta allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2020-24821: A vulnerability in the dwarf::cursor::skip_form function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24822: A vulnerability in the dwarf::cursor::uleb function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24823: A vulnerability in the dwarf::to_string function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24825: A vulnerability in the line_table::line_table function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24826: A vulnerability in the elf::section::as_strtab function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-0217: A vulnerability in processing of certain DHCP packets from adjacent clients on EX Series and QFX Series switches running Juniper Networks Junos OS with DHCP local/relay server configured may lead to exhaustion of DMA memory causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Over time, exploitation of this vulnerability may cause traffic to stop being forwarded, or to crashing of the fxpc process. When Packet DMA heap utilization reaches 99%, the system will become unstable.

This could lead to local denial of service with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-156260178\n\n- CVE-2021-0420: In memory management driver, there is a possible system crash due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05403499; Issue ID: ALPS05381065.\n\n- CVE-2021-0422: In memory management driver, there is a possible system crash due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05403499; Issue ID: ALPS05381071.\n\n- CVE-2021-0424: In memory management driver, there is a possible system crash due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05403499; Issue ID: ALPS05393787.\n\n- CVE-2021-20185: It was found in Moodle before version 3.10.1, 3.9.4, 3.8.7 and 3.5.16 that messaging did not impose a character limit when sending messages, which could result in client-side (browser) denial of service for users receiving very large messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-29430: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a duration string with a large exponent.\n\n- CVE-2021-32699: Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38463: The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources. A user may be able to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38465: The webinstaller is a Golang web server executable that enables the generation of an Auvesy image agent. Resource consumption can be achieved by generating large amounts of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3912: OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).\n\n- CVE-2021-41546: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-41167: modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-42262: An issue was discovered in Softing OPC UA C++ SDK before 5.70. An invalid XML element in the type dictionary makes the OPC/UA client crash due to an out-of-memory condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-35210: A vulnerability in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via a Raft session flooding attack using Raft OpenSessionRequest messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-32476: A denial-of-service risk was identified in the draft files area, due to it not respecting user file upload limits. Moodle versions 3.10 to 3.10.3, 3.9 to 3.9.6, 3.8 to 3.8.8, 3.5 to 3.5.17 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-43662: totolink EX300_v2, ver V4.0.3c.140_B20210429 and A720R ,ver V4.1.5cu.470_B20200911 have an issue which causes uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust process memory of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient queue management for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-3569: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to either immediately crash the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or make it consume available memory and eventually crash. The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device. These vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44988: Jerryscript v3.0.0 and below was discovered to contain a stack overflow via ecma_find_named_property in ecma-helpers.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-46050: A Stack Overflow vulnerability exists in Binaryen 103 via the printf_common function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29503: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the libpthread linuxthreads functionality of uClibC 0.9.33.2 and uClibC-ng 1.0.40.

The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

This issue affects: SUSE Manager Server 4.1 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.1.46. SUSE Manager Server 4.2 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.2.37. \n\n- CVE-2022-23487: js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

An attacker can execute JavaScript code in the browser of the victim if a site is loaded. The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0.

Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.

The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2354: The WP-DBManager WordPress plugin before 2.80.8 does not prevent administrators from running arbitrary commands on the server in multisite installations, where only super-administrators should.\n\n- CVE-2022-32310: An access control issue in Ingredient Stock Management System v1.0 allows attackers to take over user accounts via a crafted POST request to /isms/classes/Users.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-21678: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `tests-passed` branch, version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `beta` branch, and version 2.7.13 in the `stable` branch, the bios of users who made their profiles private were still visible in the `<meta>` tags on their users' pages. The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.\n\n- CVE-2022-2462: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace.

In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

The address list is freed under RCU and at this time, it puts the refs on those peers. Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock. However, it is now being called from afss RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock.

The address list is freed under RCU and at this time, it puts the refs on those peers. Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock. However, it is now being called from afss RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock. The put may also be called from non-BH context, and so there exists the possibility of deadlock if the BH-based RCU cleanup happens whilst the hash spinlock is held.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy. Possibly related to improper permissions, large-window race condition.\n\n- CVE-2000-0338: Chain: predictable file names used for locking, allowing attacker to create the lock beforehand. Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05862986; Issue ID: ALPS05862986.\n\n- CVE-2022-21775: In sched driver, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06479032; Issue ID: ALPS06479032.\n\n- CVE-2022-26452: In isp, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07262305; Issue ID: ALPS07262305.\n\n- CVE-2022-26473: In vdec fmt, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07342197; Issue ID: ALPS07342197.\n\n- CVE-2022-32811: A memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2009-4017: Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2005-4650: CMS does not restrict the number of searches that can occur simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2020-15100: web application scanner attempts to read an excessively large file created by a user, causing process termination\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19463: An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-19464: An issue has been found in function XRef::fetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow .\n\n- CVE-2021-29324: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component /moddable/xs/sources/xsScript.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-29329: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute function at /moddable/xs/sources/xsTree.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-41800: MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time). Visiting Special:Contributions can sometimes result in a long running SQL query because PoolCounter protection is mishandled.\n\n- CVE-2021-35492: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.11+5 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata vhost parameter. This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)\n\n- CVE-2021-22174: Crash in USB HID dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.2 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2020-22785: Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a missing lock check which could cause a denial of service. Aggressively targeting random pad import endpoints with empty data would flatten all pads due to lack of rate limiting and missing ownership check.\n\n- CVE-2021-33831: api/account/register in the TH Wildau COVID-19 Contact Tracing application through 2021-09-01 has Incorrect Access Control. An attacker can interfere with tracing of infection chains by creating 500 random users within 2500 seconds.\n\n- CVE-2020-28200: The Sieve engine in Dovecot before 2.3.15 allows Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, as demonstrated by a situation with a complex regular expression for the regex extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-41591: ACINQ Eclair before 0.6.3 allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2021-41592: Blockstream c-lightning through 0.10.1 allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2021-41593: Lightning Labs lnd before 0.13.3-beta allows loss of funds because of dust HTLC exposure.\n\n- CVE-2020-24821: A vulnerability in the dwarf::cursor::skip_form function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24822: A vulnerability in the dwarf::cursor::uleb function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24823: A vulnerability in the dwarf::to_string function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24825: A vulnerability in the line_table::line_table function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24826: A vulnerability in the elf::section::as_strtab function of Libelfin v0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) through a segmentation fault via a crafted ELF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-0217: A vulnerability in processing of certain DHCP packets from adjacent clients on EX Series and QFX Series switches running Juniper Networks Junos OS with DHCP local/relay server configured may lead to exhaustion of DMA memory causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Over time, exploitation of this vulnerability may cause traffic to stop being forwarded, or to crashing of the fxpc process.

Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust.

All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38463: The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources. A user may be able to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38465: The webinstaller is a Golang web server executable that enables the generation of an Auvesy image agent. Resource consumption can be achieved by generating large amounts of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3912: OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).\n\n- CVE-2021-41546: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-41167: modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-42262: An issue was discovered in Softing OPC UA C++ SDK before 5.70.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-3569: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to either immediately crash the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or make it consume available memory and eventually crash. The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device. These vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44988: Jerryscript v3.0.0 and below was discovered to contain a stack overflow via ecma_find_named_property in ecma-helpers.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-46050: A Stack Overflow vulnerability exists in Binaryen 103 via the printf_common function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29503: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the libpthread linuxthreads functionality of uClibC 0.9.33.2 and uClibC-ng 1.0.40.

This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1708: A vulnerability was found in CRI-O that causes memory or disk space exhaustion on the node for anyone with access to the Kube API. The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

This issue affects: SUSE Manager Server 4.1 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.1.46. SUSE Manager Server 4.2 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.2.37. \n\n- CVE-2022-23487: js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

NOTE: although this was fixed by Brave, the Brave documentation still advises \"Note that Private Windows with Tor Connectivity in Brave are just regular private windows that use Tor as a proxy. Brave does NOT implement most of the privacy protections from Tor Browser.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-39193: An issue was discovered in the CheckUser extension for MediaWiki through 1.39.x. Various components of this extension can expose information on the performer of edits and logged actions. This information should not allow public viewing: it is supposed to be viewable only by users with suppression rights.\n\n- CVE-2022-31308: A vulnerability in live_mfg.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.191012 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-31309: A vulnerability in live_check.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.180719 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-35147: DoraCMS v2.18 and earlier allows attackers to bypass login authentication via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-20260: A flaw was found in the Foreman project. The Datacenter plugin exposes the password through the API to an authenticated local attacker with view_hosts permission. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23538: github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce plugin <= 1.7.7 at WordPress leading to &yikes-the-content-toggle option update. \n\n- CVE-2021-36369: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05.

In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service.

It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-23471: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2.

The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing.

An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized. Here are two payloads (due to two different exploitations depending on which parameter you act) to exploit the vulnerability:/ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=javascript:alert(document.cookie)&_itemtype=DisplayPreference&_glpi_tab=DisplayPreference$2&id=258&displaytype=Ticket (Payload triggered if you click on the button). /ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=/front/ticket.form.php&_itemtype=Ticket&_glpi_tab=Ticket$1&id=(){};(function%20(){alert(document.cookie);})();function%20a&#.\n\n- CVE-2021-39175: HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. In versions prior to 1.9.0, an unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the speaker-notes of the slide-mode feature by embedding an iframe hosting the malicious code into the slides or by embedding the HedgeDoc instance into another page. The problem is patched in version 1.9.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-42117: Insufficient Input Validation in Web Applications operating on Business-DNA Solutions GmbH\u2019s TopEase\u00ae Platform Version <= 7.1.27 allows an authenticated remote attacker with Object Modification privileges to insert arbitrary HTML without code execution.\n\n- CVE-2020-4520: IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0 and 11.1 could allow a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code that when viewed by the authenticated victim would execute the code.

Users of MuWire desktop client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized by an attacker who knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject line containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8. As a workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other users from sending them malicious messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-42367: The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in the ~/includes/class-menu-page.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.1.1.

This can then be leveraged to execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack to escalate privileges to administrator.\n\n- CVE-2021-43862: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2.

(EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP.

The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

An unauthenticated user can gain read-only access to XCC in such a configuration, thereby allowing the XCC device configuration to be viewed but not changed. XCC devices configured to use local authentication, LDAP Authentication + Authorization Mode, or LDAP servers that support only \u201cauthenticated bind\u201d and/or \u201canonymous bind\u201d are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-1983: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 10.7 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1, allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Key or a Deploy Token to misuse it from any location to access Container Registries even when IP address restrictions were configured.\n\n- CVE-2022-29271: In Nagios XI through 5.8.5, a read-only Nagios user (due to an incorrect permission check) is able to schedule downtime for any host/services. This allows an attacker to permanently disable all monitoring checks.\n\n- CVE-2022-34782: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.16 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-3819: An improper authorization issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 15.0 prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows a malicious users to set emojis on internal notes they don't have access to.\n\n- CVE-2022-40816: Zammad 5.2.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Zammad's asset handling mechanism has logic to ensure that customer users are not able to see personal information of other users. This logic was not effective when used through a web socket connection, so that a logged-in attacker would be able to fetch personal data of other users by querying the Zammad API. This issue is fixed in , 5.2.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45383: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins Support Core Plugin 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a previously created support bundle containing information limited to users with Overall/Administer permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-46076: D-Link DIR-869 DIR869Ax_FW102B15 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via phpcgi.\n\n- CVE-2021-24917: The WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 has a bug which allows to get the secret login page by setting a random referer string and making a request to /wp-admin/options.php as an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1746: The authentication mechanism used by poll workers to administer voting using the tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X can expose cryptographic secrets used to protect election information.

PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options.

For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection.
