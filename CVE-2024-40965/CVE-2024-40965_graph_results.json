  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c lpi2c Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer Instead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each transfer, lock the clock rate and cache the value. A deadlock has been observed while adding tlv320aic32x4 audio codec to the system. When this clock provider adds its clock, the clk mutex is locked already, it needs to access i2c, which in return needs the mutex for clk_get_rate as well.",
