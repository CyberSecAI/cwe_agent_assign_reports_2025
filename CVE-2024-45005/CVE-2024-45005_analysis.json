  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM s390 fix validity interception issue when gisa is switched off We might run into a SIE validity if gisa has been disabled either via using kernel parameter kvm.use_gisa=0 or by setting the related sysfs attribute to N (echo N >/sys/module/kvm/parameters/use_gisa). The validity is caused by an invalid value in the SIE control blocks gisa designation. That happens because we pass the uninitialized gisa origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation. To fix this we return 0 in kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() if the origin is 0. kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() is used to determine which gisa designation to set in the SIE control block. A value of 0 in the gisa designation disables gisa usage. The issue surfaces in the host kernel with the following kernel message as soon a new kvm guest start is attemted. kvm unhandled validity intercept 0x1011 WARNING CPU 0 PID 781237 at arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c101 kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x42e/0x4d0 [kvm] Modules linked in vhost_net tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack ipt_REJECT xt_tcpudp nft_compat x_tables nf_nat_tftp nf_conntrack_tftp vfio_pci_core irqbypass vhost_vsock vmw_vsock_virtio_transport_common vsock vhost vhost_iotlb kvm nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject nft_ct nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 ip_set nf_tables sunrpc mlx5_ib i",

The vulnerability arises from using an uninitialized variable, which leads to an invalid value in the SIE control blocks gisa designation. The relationship between CWE-457 and CWE-665 is a parent-child relationship. CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions) is a potential secondary CWE because the code doesn't properly check if gisa is disabled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe754 -->|RELATED| cwe457\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe457 primary\n    class cwe665,cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uninitialized variable** `gisa origin`. Because this variable is not initialized, it leads to an invalid value being written to the SIE control block's `gisa designation`. This, in turn, causes a validity intercept and a kernel panic.\n\nRoot Cause: **Uninitialized Variable** (CWE-457) -> Invalid Value in SIE Control Block -> Kernel Panic\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-457). The evidence for this is the statement that \"we pass the **uninitialized** gisa origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation\" from the vulnerability description and `\"The vulnerability arises from passing an uninitialized gisa origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation in the SIE control block\"` from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. This directly leads to the observed behavior. The relationship data show CWE-457 as a variant of CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), supporting the classification.\n\nCWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions) was considered because the code doesn't seem to check for the disabled gisa case properly. However, the primary root cause is the use of the uninitialized variable.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-457 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while considering the higher-level CWE-665 provides additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
