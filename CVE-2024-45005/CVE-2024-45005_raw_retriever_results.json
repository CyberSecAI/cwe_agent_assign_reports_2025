  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM s390 fix validity interception issue when gisa is switched off We might run into a SIE validity if gisa has been disabled either via using kernel parameter kvm.use_gisa=0 or by setting the related sysfs attribute to N (echo N >/sys/module/kvm/parameters/use_gisa). The validity is caused by an invalid value in the SIE control blocks gisa designation. That happens because we pass the uninitialized gisa origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation. To fix this we return 0 in kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() if the origin is 0. kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() is used to determine which gisa designation to set in the SIE control block. A value of 0 in the gisa designation disables gisa usage. The issue surfaces in the host kernel with the following kernel message as soon a new kvm guest start is attemted. kvm unhandled validity intercept 0x1011 WARNING CPU 0 PID 781237 at arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c101 kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x42e/0x4d0 [kvm] Modules linked in vhost_net tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack ipt_REJECT xt_tcpudp nft_compat x_tables nf_nat_tftp nf_conntrack_tftp vfio_pci_core irqbypass vhost_vsock vmw_vsock_virtio_transport_common vsock vhost vhost_iotlb kvm nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject nft_ct nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 ip_set nf_tables sunrpc mlx5_ib i",
