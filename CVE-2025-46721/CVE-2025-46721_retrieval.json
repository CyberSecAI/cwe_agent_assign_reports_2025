  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-46721', description='nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via **XSS**, or otherwise) to **bypass CSRF checks** and issue requests on users behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site same-origin` header in the request).', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'misuse of the Go net/http library', 'weakness': ['bypass CSRF checks', 'XSS'], 'impact': ['bypass CSRF checks', 'manipulate cookies'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'nosurf', 'version': 'prior to 1.2.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Here\\'s an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2025-46721:\\n\\n**Content from github.com_753e0f66_20250624_211006.html (stripped)**\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the Referer header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained XSS on a subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level domain.\\n*   **Attack vectors:**  An attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have gained XSS on a subdomain or top-level domain.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0.\\n\\n**Content from github.com_b1dcb76b_20250624_211007.html (stripped)**\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** All versions of nosurf before 1.2.0 failed to apply same-origin checks for incoming requests.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via **XSS**, or otherwise) to **bypass CSRF checks** and issue requests on users behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site same-origin` header in the request).\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'misuse of the Go net/http library'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
