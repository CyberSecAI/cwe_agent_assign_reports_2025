The impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nNot explicitly detailed, but inherent to CSRF - relies on tricking a logged-in user into performing an action on a vulnerable web application.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nNo official fix available. Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Doppler Forms WordPress Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable versions:** <= 2.4.7\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** Skalucy\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack\n*   **PSID:** 149834c52e5f\n*   The report states that the vulnerability is unlikely to be exploited due to its low severity.",

The **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) can lead to **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) if a **CSRF** attack is used to inject malicious script into the web application.\nCWE-352 is a compound weakness and is used here as the root cause of the stored **XSS**.\nCWE-79 is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system. This injected code is then stored, leading to a Stored **XSS** vulnerability.\n\nCWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was to map CWE-352 as the primary cause, which allows for the injection of code, and then CWE-79 because the injected code leads to Stored **XSS**. This assessment is based on the provided evidence, mainly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which state:\n\n*   **rootcause:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery**\n*   **weakness:** **XSS**\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the CANPRECEDE relationship between **CSRF** and **XSS**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
