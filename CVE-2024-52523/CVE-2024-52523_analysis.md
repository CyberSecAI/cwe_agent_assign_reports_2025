# Analysis for CVE-2024-52523

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Addresses the direct transmission of credentials in plaintext. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary - The credentials are not just transmitted, but also stored in a way that allows plaintext retrieval. |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary - Sensitive information (credentials) is included in the data sent via the API. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship guiding the selection was the chain involving data handling. The vulnerability involves:
  - Transmission of sensitive data (credentials) in cleartext (CWE-319)
  - A contributing factor is the storage of such credentials in a manner that allows retrieval in plaintext (CWE-312).
  - The credentials being included in data being sent (CWE-201).

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events leading to the vulnerability is as follows:
  1. External storage configured with fixed credentials.
  2. API incorrectly returns these credentials in plain text.
  3. Frontend receives and exposes these credentials due to **lack of proper handling of sensitive data**.
  4. Attacker with access to a user session views the credentials.

Root cause: Incorrect API response including credentials.
Impact: Credentials exposed leading to potential compromise of external storage.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the subsequent weaknesses. The primary weakness is the transmission of credentials in cleartext. Supporting this is the storage of credentials in a way that allows their retrieval in plain text. The graph relationships helped frame the analysis, showing how the weaknesses are related. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details strongly supports the selection of CWE-319 as the primary CWE. The decision is further reinforced by the fact that the fix involves marking the password parameter as "sensitive," which directly relates to preventing its transmission.

The selection of CWE-319 as the primary is based on the following evidence:
- "API returns them and adds them into the frontend again, allowing to read them in plain text"
- "The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user or administrator sets up an external storage with fixed credentials (e.g., password), the API incorrectly returns these credentials and includes them in the frontend"

CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, which is the core issue.

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
