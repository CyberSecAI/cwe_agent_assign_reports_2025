## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/mediatek Fix **NULL pointer deference** in mtk_iommu_device_group Currently, mtk_iommu calls during probe iommu_device_register before the hw_list from driver data is initialized. Since iommu probing issue fix, it leads to NULL pointer **dereference** in mtk_iommu_device_group when hw_list is accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe). So, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register is called after the driver data are initialized.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **NULL pointer deference**
- **weakness:** **dereference**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** iommu/mediatek Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group
