  "query": "Vulnerability in the MySQL Connectors product of Oracle MySQL (component Connector/Python). Supported versions that are affected are 9.1.0 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all MySQL Connectors accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Connectors accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Connectors.
