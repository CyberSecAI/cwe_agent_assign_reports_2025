    ## WEAKNESS: 'stack-based buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 378.94)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....

### 2. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Score: 323.91)

The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow....

### 3. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 277.72)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....
