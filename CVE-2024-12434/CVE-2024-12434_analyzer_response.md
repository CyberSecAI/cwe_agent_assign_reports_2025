| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class |  Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**, which is a Class-level CWE. Related to this, we considered **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** and **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)** as contributing factors. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), while CWE-862 is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). The relationships suggest that the root cause might involve either **missing** or **improper** authorization or authentication, leading to sensitive information exposure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** or **missing authentication** check. This leads to a situation where an unauthenticated attacker can access the REST API endpoint and extract sensitive data, ultimately resulting in **Sensitive Information Exposure**.

Missing Authorization/Authentication -> REST API Access -> Sensitive Data Exposure

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the SureMembers plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** via the REST API, which can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

The evidence supporting this is: "This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including restricted content."

The **Retriever Results** list CWE-200, **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, as the top candidate. The description matches the vulnerability. This is further supported by the fact that the attackers are unauthenticated, suggesting a **missing authorization** or **authentication** issue. Therefore, CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, and CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, are considered as secondary CWEs.

CWE-200 is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability's ultimate impact is **sensitive information exposure**. The other CWEs are considered as potential root causes or contributing factors.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Used:* CSRF is not directly indicated in the description.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* While the description involves unauthorized access, it is more about **missing authorization** than inadequate enforcement.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE is not related to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* The vulnerability description doesn't specifically mention user-controlled keys.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE is not directly relevant to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE is not directly relevant to the vulnerability description. The sensitive information is exposed, but not necessarily because it's placed in externally accessible files.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* While sensitive information is sent, the core issue is the exposure due to **missing authorization**.

## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This is a specific type of **Exposure of Sensitive Information**, but the description doesn't limit the exposure to personal information.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Used as Secondary:* The vulnerability description indicates that unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive data, implying that there is a **missing authorization** check.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares
