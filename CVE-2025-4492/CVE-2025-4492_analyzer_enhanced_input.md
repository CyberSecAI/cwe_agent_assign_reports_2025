## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4492. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/routers/ticket-message.php' file of the 'Online Food Ordering System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'ticket\_id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The '/routers/ticket-message.php' file is vulnerable.
*   The 'ticket\_id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the '/routers/ticket-message.php' endpoint.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload examples:**

*   `role=Administrator&ticket_id=-7422 OR 4555=4555#&message=123asdasdasdasdas&action=` (boolean-based blind)
*   `role=Administrator&ticket_id=1 AND (SELECT 9626 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))yJQB)&message=123asdasdasdasdas&action=` (time-based blind)
