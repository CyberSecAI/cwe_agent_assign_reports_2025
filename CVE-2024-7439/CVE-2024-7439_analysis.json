Affected by this issue is the function read of the component httpd. The manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-273524. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the affected release tree is end-of-life.",

This likely means the attacker must be on the same network segment as the device or be able to route traffic to it.\n\nThis content provides more details than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable field (`Content-Length`) and the affected component (`httpd`).",

CWE-130 [Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency] can precede CWE-805 [Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value] which could lead to a buffer overflow. The selection of CWE-121 is based on the explicit mention of \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe130,cwe805 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of the Content-Length** (CWE-130), leading to an incorrect buffer size or access (CWE-805), and ultimately resulting in a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **stack-based buffer overflow**, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The manipulation of the `Content-Length` argument is the vector, but the root cause is the **improper handling** of the length, resulting in a buffer overflow on the stack.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-121 is directly supported by the phrase \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The description also highlights that the \"manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to stack-based buffer overflow\". This is strong evidence for selecting CWE-121 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-121 [Stack-based Buffer Overflow], albeit with a lower score than CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]. However, given the explicit mention of \"stack-based buffer overflow,\" CWE-121 is the more specific and accurate choice.\n\nI considered CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer] but selected CWE-121 because it is more specific. I also considered CWE-130 [Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency] as a contributing factor to the overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
