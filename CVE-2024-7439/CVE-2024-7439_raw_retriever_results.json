The manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-273524. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the affected release tree is end-of-life.",
