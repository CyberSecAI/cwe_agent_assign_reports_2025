# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-42229
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use I.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding cryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer needed. Accomplish this by using kfree_sensitive for buffers that previously held the private key.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'zeroize key buffer after use'
