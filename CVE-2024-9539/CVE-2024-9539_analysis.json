  "description": "An **information disclosure vulnerability** was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server via attacker uploaded asset URL allowing the attacker to retrieve metadata information of a user who clicks on the URL and further exploit it to create a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVG files and phish a victim user to click on that uploaded asset URL. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.14 and was fixed in versions 3.14.2, 3.13.5, 3.12.10, 3.11.16. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.",

While this is a higher-level abstraction, it accurately captures the fundamental **information disclosure vulnerability**. CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is considered a secondary CWE because the vulnerability is triggered by a user clicking on a URL containing a malicious SVG, suggesting a failure to properly neutralize input, which leads to the information disclosure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker uploading a malicious SVG file. The victim then clicks on a URL associated with this file. This action leads to the exposure of the victim's metadata, which is a form of sensitive information. The root cause is the **information disclosure vulnerability** itself (CWE-200). The **improper neutralization** (CWE-79) of the SVG content allows for the information to be extracted and exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified an **information disclosure vulnerability** (CWE-200) where an attacker could retrieve metadata of a user. The vulnerability is triggered by uploading malicious SVG files and tricking a user to click the asset URL. This could be used to create a convincing phishing page.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that \"Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL\" and lists Cross-site Scripting (XSS) as a weakness. This suggests that the improper handling of the SVG file content is a contributing factor, leading to the inclusion of CWE-79.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the explicit mention of \"information disclosure vulnerability\" in the description and the \"root_cause\" in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states that \"Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL.\" This highlights the direct exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. CWE-79 is added because of the evidence of the SVG not being handled correctly. Both are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-200 being a Class and CWE-79 being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
