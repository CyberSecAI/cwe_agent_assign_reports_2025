  "query": "An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server via attacker uploaded asset URL allowing the attacker to retrieve metadata information of a user who clicks on the URL and further exploit it to create a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVG files and phish a victim user to click on that uploaded asset URL. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.14 and was fixed in versions 3.14.2, 3.13.5, 3.12.10, 3.11.16. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.",
