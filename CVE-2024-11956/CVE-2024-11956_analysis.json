  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-11956 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval) based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content **relates** to a security vulnerability in the `pimcore/customer-data-framework` package. It details an SQL injection vulnerability (GHSA-q53r-9hh9-w277) and provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from unsanitized input being used directly in SQL queries within the `customer-data-framework`. Specifically, the parameters `filterDefinition` and `filter` in the `GET /admin/customermanagementframework/customers/list` endpoint are vulnerable.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection (CWE-564)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n*   Data modification.\n*   Potential for complete server compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based attack via HTTP GET request to a specific endpoint: `/admin/customermanagementframework/customers/list` with crafted parameters.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated user with access to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   Ability to craft and send malicious HTTP GET requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 4.2.1 or later of the `pimcore/customer-data-framework` package.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected versions:** `<4.2.1`\n*   **Patched versions:** `4.2.1`\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.2 (High)\n*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n*   **Reporter:** @maeitsec\n*   **PoC:** A specific URL is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability was found in the demo environment: `https://demo.pimcore.fun`",

The vulnerability is due to **SQL Injection** |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE and is the most specific. The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (**CWE-89**). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.\n2.  **Impact:** This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is **SQL Injection**. The analysis is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"sql injection\" as the root cause. The vulnerability arises from the **manipulation of the argument filterDefinition/filter**, indicating that user-supplied input is not being properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-89.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support the selection of CWE-89, with a score of 1.0. Other CWEs, like CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting), CWE-22 (Path Traversal), CWE-95 (Eval Injection), and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), were considered but ultimately rejected because the vulnerability description specifically points to **SQL Injection**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Base level CWE that accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence clearly indicates that the vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**, which is the defining characteristic of CWE-89.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
