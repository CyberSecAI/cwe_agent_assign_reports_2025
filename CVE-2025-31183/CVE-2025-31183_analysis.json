Specifically, the description states that an app may be able to **access** sensitive user data. The phrase \"improved restriction of data container access\" suggests that the fix involved restricting access that was previously too permissive.\n\nThe evidence to support this is weak, as the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section contains the word \"UNRELATED\". However, the vulnerability description and key phrases points to access control issues as a **root cause**, so I am selecting CWE-277.\n\nCWE-787, CWE-665, CWE-843, CWE-285, CWE-20, CWE-415, CWE-119, CWE-347, and CWE-825 were considered, but deemed less relevant because the primary issue appears to be related to insecure permissions, rather than out-of-bounds writes, improper initialization, type confusion, improper authorization, input validation, double free, or pointer dereference.",
