The **memory corruption** can be triggered by **Out-of-bounds Write** which is the root cause.\nCWE-787 is a base level CWE and is a child of CWE-119 \"Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\".\nCWE-416 and CWE-415 are peer relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -- PEEROF --> cwe415\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe415 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **memory corruption** when preparing a shared memory notification for a memparcel in Resource Manager, which leads to **out-of-bounds write**.\n  - Root cause: **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**\n  - Impact: **Memory corruption**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on identifying the root cause of the **memory corruption**, which is the **out-of-bounds write**.\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the **memory corruption** occurs when preparing a shared memory notification. The high retriever score for CWE-787 and the direct match with the vulnerability description support this selection.\n\nCWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **out-of-bounds write** condition that causes the **memory corruption**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n- **weakness:** **Memory corruption**\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by helping to understand the context and potential consequences of the vulnerability.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of

with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer

or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 345.06\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 342.63\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 329.75\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory",
