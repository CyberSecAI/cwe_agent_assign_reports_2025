# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45623

## Vulnerability Description
D-Link DAP-2310 Hardware A Firmware 1.16RC028 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the ATP binary that handles PHP HTTP GET requests for the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** PHP HTTP GET requests
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** D-Link DAP-2310
- **version:** Hardware A Firmware 1.16RC028
- **component:** ATP binary

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the ATP binary, which handles PHP HTTP requests for the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) running on the D-Link DAP-2310 Wireless Access Point.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the ATP binary.
- Improper handling of HTTP requests, specifically through the Apache HTTP Server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the device, triggering the buffer overflow in the ATP binary.
- Utilizing a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to call the `system()` function for arbitrary command execution.
- The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This generally means being on the same network as the device or having network access to it.
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is named "BouncyPufferfish" by the reporting party, Dark Wolf Solutions.
- The vulnerability is present in DAP-2310 Hardware Revision A, Firmware v 1.16RC028.
- The device is end-of-life and no longer supported, meaning there will be no patch.
- D-Link recommends that the device be replaced to mitigate this vulnerability.

This content provides more details than a typical CVE entry by explaining the vulnerability's mechanism (stack-based buffer overflow, ROP chain, `system()` call) and the name of the exploit (BouncyPufferfish).
