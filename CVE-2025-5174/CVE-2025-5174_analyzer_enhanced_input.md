## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in erdogant pypickle up to 1.1.5 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function load of the file pypickle/pypickle.py. The manipulation leads to **deserialization**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as 14b4cae704a0bb4eb6723e238f25382d847a1917. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **deserialization**
- **product:** Erdogant PyPickle
- **version:** up to 1.1.5
- **component:** load of the file pypickle/pypickle.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `load()` function in `pypickle.py` uses Pythonâ€™s `pickle.load()` to deserialize data from a file without validating or sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by supplying a malicious pickle file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure deserialization: Using `pickle.load()` without proper input validation.
- Lack of input sanitization: The code does not validate or sanitize the data being deserialized.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution
- Remote system compromise

Attack vectors:
- An attacker can create a malicious pickle file and trick a user into loading it using the `pypickle.load()` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious pickle file to the system where the `pypickle` library is used.

Mitigation or fix:
- The release 2.0.0 introduces validation steps to check for high-risk modules before loading pickle files.
- The `validate` parameter can be used to explicitly allow risky modules or disable validation (not recommended).
- The `validate_modules` function can be used to check the modules in a pickle file without loading it.
- Restrictions on saving pickle files to specific locations (home and temp directories are safe by default).
- Path traversal detection to prevent saving to system-critical paths.
- File extension validation (.pkl, .pickle, .pklz, .pbz2).
