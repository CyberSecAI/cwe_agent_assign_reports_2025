# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-43843

## Vulnerability Description
Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to **command injection**. The variables exp_dir1, np7 and f0method8 take user input and pass it into the extract_f0_feature function, which concatenates them into a command that is run on the server. This can lead to arbitrary command execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **product:** Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI
- **version:** 2.2.231006 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-43843 is related to the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `infer-web.py` script passes user-controlled input (`exp_dir1`, `np7`, `trainset_dir4`, and `sr2`) directly into a command that is then executed by the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Command Injection (CWE-77)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary command execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious commands through the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to control the input values for `exp_dir1`, `np7`, `trainset_dir4`, and `sr2`.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The content does not provide a specific fix, but it implies that proper input sanitization or parameterization of the command is necessary to prevent command injection.
