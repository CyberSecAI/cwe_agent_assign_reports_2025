# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-24554

## Vulnerability Description
Bludit uses predictable methods in combination with the MD5 hashing algorithm to generate sensitive tokens such as the API token and the user token. This allows attackers to authenticate against the Bludit API.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **predictable methods to generate tokens**
- **impact:** authenticate against Bludit API
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Bludit

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The API and user auth tokens are generated using a combination of `uniqid()`, `time()`, and the website's domain, then hashed with MD5. The use of `uniqid()` which is based on current time in microseconds and is not cryptographically secure, combined with the usage of MD5 makes tokens predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure token generation using non-cryptographically secure functions (uniqid, time) and a weak hashing algorithm (MD5).
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially bypass authentication and gain access to the Bludit API by brute-forcing the predictable tokens.
- Attack vectors: Brute-forcing the tokens based on the predictability of the components used for token generation.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know the target website's domain. The API must also be enabled by the administrator.
