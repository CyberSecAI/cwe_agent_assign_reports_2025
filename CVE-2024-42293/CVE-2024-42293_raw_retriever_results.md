# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-42293
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 mm Fix lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding Lina reports random oopsen originating from the fast GUP code when 16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level being folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2. In this configuration, the generic implementation of p4d_offset_lockless() will return a p4d_t * corresponding to the pgd_t allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range(). This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the p4d_t to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page. This results in a stray stack read when the p4d_t has been allocated on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds. Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless() when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table pointer rather than the address of the local stack variable.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lockless walks with static', 'dynamic page-table folding'
- **weakness**: 'stack corruption'
