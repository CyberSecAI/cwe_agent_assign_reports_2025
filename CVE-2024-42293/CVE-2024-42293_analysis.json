  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 mm Fix **lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding** Lina reports random oopsen originating from the fast GUP code when 16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level being folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2. In this configuration, the generic implementation of p4d_offset_lockless() will return a p4d_t * corresponding to the pgd_t allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range(). This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the p4d_t to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page. This results in a stray stack read when the p4d_t has been allocated on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds. Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless() when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table pointer rather than the address of the local stack variable.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's arm64 architecture, specifically when using 16K pages with 4-level page tables and dynamic folding of the fourth level due to lack of LPA2.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The generic implementation of `p4d_offset_lockless()` returns a `p4d_t *` corresponding to the `pgd_t` allocated on the stack of the caller (in `gup_fast_pgd_range()`).\n- When the fourth level of the page table is folded at runtime, `pud_offset_lockless()` calculates the address of the PUD by offsetting from the address of this stack-allocated `p4d_t`. This results in an out-of-bounds stack read when accessing the PUD, potentially causing a crash or other undefined behavior.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Incorrect pointer calculation:** The `pud_offset_lockless()` function assumes that the provided `p4d_t *` points to a valid page table entry, but in this specific scenario, it's pointing to a stack variable, leading to a stack out-of-bounds read.\n- **Lack of awareness of dynamic page-table folding:** The generic `p4d_offset_lockless()` function doesn't account for the scenario where the fourth level page table is folded at runtime, leading to incorrect pointer arithmetic.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **System crash:** The out-of-bounds stack read can cause a kernel oops, leading to a system crash or instability.\n- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads can potentially be leveraged for other forms of exploitation, but this is not detailed in the provided information.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered during page table walks. Specifically, it manifests when 16K pages are used with 4-level page tables where the fourth level is dynamically folded due to the lack of LPA2.\n- The vulnerability occurs during operations that use the fast GUP (Get User Pages) path, which is used to efficiently map user-space memory into the kernel.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the fast GUP code path with memory mappings that involve the specific page table configurations (16k pages, 4-level page tables with dynamic folding of 4th level) to exploit this issue.\n- The attacker would need to execute code that leads to the faulting page table walk, probably through triggering a specific memory access pattern or system call.",

CWE-823 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), highlighting the broader category of memory access issues. CWE-823 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), indicating potential consequences. The relationship between CWE-823 and CWE-125 is important, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"out-of-bounds stack read,\" making CWE-125 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe823 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect** pointer calculation due to the generic implementation of `p4d_offset_lockless()` not accounting for dynamic page-table folding. This leads to the use of an out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823), which in turn results in an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) and, ultimately, a system crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which provide ample evidence to support the CWE mappings. The description clearly indicates that the **root cause** is an issue with pointer arithmetic when page tables are dynamically folded, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the stack. This is a classic instance of using an out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823). The hierarchical relationships, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-823 and CWE-119, helped refine the selection. The retriever results provided several potential CWEs, but after careful review, CWE-823 emerged as the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability's **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected*: This CWE relates to locking issues which is not the case in the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected*: This CWE relates to release of resources which is not the case in the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: The vulnerability description clearly states there is an out-of-range pointer offset and **not** that an uninitialized pointer is accessed.*\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not selected*: This is a very general CWE and does not accurately describe the vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: This vulnerability description does not indicate any missing check on a return value.*\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
