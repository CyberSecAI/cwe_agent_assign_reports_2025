**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized input in the query string within the Koji web interface. HTML tag characters are not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code injected via a crafted URL can be reflected in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
