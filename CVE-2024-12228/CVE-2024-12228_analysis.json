  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in PHPGurukul Complaint Management System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /admin/user-search.php. The manipulation of the argument search leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/user-search.php` file of the \"Complaint Management system\" version 1.0, a PHP project.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'search' parameter in the `/admin/user-search.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries directly into the SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL Injection in the `/admin/user-search.php` file.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized database access.\n- Sensitive data leakage.\n- Data tampering.\n- Comprehensive system control.\n- Service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker can inject malicious SQL queries via the 'search' parameter.\n- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically to the `/admin/user-search.php` file.\n- No authentication is required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques: boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query.\n- The provided payloads and sqlmap command-line demonstrate proof of concept.\n- The suggested remediation steps include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.",

The vulnerability is due to **insufficient user input validation** of the 'search' parameter in the `/admin/user-search.php` file, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the direct match of the vulnerability to the description of CWE-89. While other CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, they were deemed less specific to the **SQL injection** root cause. There are no relevant parent-child or chain relationships that significantly alter the primary mapping decision in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper input validation** (explicitly stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary).\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, service interruption (explicitly stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which was clearly identified as an **SQL injection** due to **insufficient input validation**. The provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this assessment. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-89 is based on the following:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\".\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is **insufficient user input validation** of the 'search' parameter, leading to **SQL injection**.\n*   The retriever results list CWE-89 as the top match with a score of 1.0.\n*   CWE-89 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n*   The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-89.\n\nThe other CWEs suggested by the retriever were considered but ultimately rejected because they represent either secondary impacts, prerequisite conditions, or are too general. For instance:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is related to output encoding and is less directly related to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is an **SQL injection**.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) does not apply because the vulnerability is not related to a template engine.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the **SQL injection** vulnerability.",
