  "description": "PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files. There is a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in the TTF parser. Maliciously crafted TTF files can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. This can also lead to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. An infinite loop occurs in the read_camp function by nGroups value. The ttf.h library is vulnerable. A value called nGroups is extracted from the file, and by changing that value, you can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. If the value of nGroups in the file is small, an infinite loop will not occur. This library, whether used as a standalone binary or as part of another application, is vulnerable to DOS attacks when parsing certain types of files. Automated systems, including web servers that use this code to convert PDF submissions into plaintext, can be DOSed if an attacker uploads a malicious TTF file. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42358:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `read_cmap` function within the `ttf.c` file of the pdfio library. Specifically, it involves an infinite loop caused by an improperly validated `nGroups` value extracted from the TTF file. Additionally, a heap-buffer-overflow can occur due to a large cmap table size.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is an infinite loop in the `read_cmap` function, specifically within the `for` loop: `for (gidx = 0, group = groups, font->num_cmap = 0; gidx < nGroups; gidx ++, group ++)`. This loop iterates based on the value of `nGroups` extracted from the TTF file. If a crafted TTF file provides a large value for nGroups, or an invalid value, this can lead to an infinite loop.\n*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code allocates memory for the `cmap` table based on the `num_cmap` value. If a crafted TTF file specifies a large value for `num_cmap`, it can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow when writing to the `cmap` table.\n* **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to adequately validate the `nGroups` value, or the size of cmap table which is extracted from the TTF file, allowing an attacker to control the loop's execution and memory allocation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the infinite loop will cause the application to consume excessive CPU resources.\n*   **Memory Exhaustion:** Due to large allocations, this can lead to memory exhaustion, making the application unresponsive.\n*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  Writing past the allocated memory can cause program crashes or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Maliciously Crafted TTF Files:** The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted TTF file to the vulnerable application. This can be done through any means by which the application processes or loads TTF files.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Ability to supply a TTF file:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious TTF file with a large or invalid `nGroups` value, or a large cmap table size, to the vulnerable application.\n*   **No privileges required:** This vulnerability can be triggered without any specific user privileges.\n*   **No user interaction required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) in the form of a `testttf-dos.ttf` file, demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed by adding range checks to the TTF loader to prevent large memory allocations and infinite loops, as demonstrated in the provided commit diffs.\n* The vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2024-42358 and GHSA-4hh9-j68x-8353.\n* The affected versions are <= v1.3.0, and there are no patched versions mentioned in this advisory. It is implied that the fix is included in v1.3.1 (mentioned in the commit log).\n* The severity is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 6.2.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-42358 is a vulnerability in the pdfio library that allows a malicious actor to cause a denial-of-service by supplying a crafted TTF file that leads to an infinite loop or heap-buffer-overflow.",

The `nGroups` value from the TTF file is not properly validated, allowing the **infinite loop** to occur, hence the inclusion of CWE-1284.
