## Vulnerability Description
The Daily Prayer Time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the max_word attribute of the quran_verse shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2024.08.26 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Daily Prayer Time plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2024.08.26
- **component:** max_word attribute of the quran_verse shortcode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `getQuote` function of the `QuranDB.php` file. Specifically, the `min_word`, `max_word` and `language` attributes of the `quran_verse` shortcode were not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The `min_word`, `max_word` and `language` attributes were directly inserted into the SQL query without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin uses `esc_attr` which is not suitable for sanitizing data to be used within SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, such as user credentials, site configuration details, or any other data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could also potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, successful exploitation could lead to full control of the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Attribute Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `min_word`, `max_word`, and `language` attributes of the `quran_verse` shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through these parameters when rendering the shortcode on a page or post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to exploit the vulnerability. This means they must have the ability to create or edit posts or pages where the vulnerable shortcode can be used.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected versions:** All versions of the "Daily Prayer Time" plugin up to and including 2024.08.26 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2024.09.14.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves removing the use of `esc_attr` and replacing it with integer validation using `intval` for `min_word` and `max_word` attributes. Additionally, the `language` attribute is checked against an allowed list of values `['english', 'bangla']`. The SQL query is constructed using `$wpdb->prepare()` for proper parameterization.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.9, indicating a critical severity.
