## Vulnerability Description
Zendesk before 2024-07-02 allows remote attackers to read ticket history via e-mail spoofing, because Cc fields are extracted from incoming e-mail messages and used to grant additional authorization for ticket viewing, the mechanism for detecting spoofed e-mail messages is insufficient, and the support e-mail addresses associated with individual tickets are predictable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient mechanism for detecting spoofed e-mail messages**
- **impact:** read ticket history
- **vector:** e-mail spoofing
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** Zendesk
- **version:** before 2024-07-02

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in Zendesk's insufficient validation and trust of email addresses, specifically its flawed implementation of email collaboration feature and the lack of proper safeguards against email spoofing. Zendesk's system was designed to automatically add a user to a ticket if they are CC'd on an email sent to the support+id{id}@company.com address and that it assumes that the sender is the original requester of the ticket if an email is sent to that address. The vulnerability arises because the email addresses, specifically the ticket ID, is easily guessable as it's incremental and because Zendesk didn't validate the "From" email address, this allowed an attacker to impersonate any user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Email Spoofing Vulnerability:** Zendesk doesn't validate the authenticity of the "From" email address, allowing attackers to easily spoof emails.
2.  **Predictable Ticket IDs:** Zendesk uses sequential, predictable ticket IDs in the reply-to email addresses (support+id{id}@company.com), making it easy for attackers to guess valid ticket identifiers.
3.  **Unverified Email Collaboration:** Zendesk automatically adds CC'd email addresses to tickets without proper verification, trusting any email that claims to be from the original requester, this bypasses the need for the attacker to have any form of legitimate access to a valid email account in order to get added to the ticket.
4.  **Lack of Proper Input Validation:**  Zendesk does not validate that an email address belongs to a legitimate user of a company when an Apple ID is used for log in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Unauthorized Access to Support Tickets:** Attackers can gain access to support ticket histories, including potentially sensitive information.
2.  **Data Breach:** The content of support tickets, which may include PII, credentials, or other sensitive data, could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.
3.  **Slack Account Takeover:** By combining the email spoofing and access to support tickets with the ability to create Apple IDs with the @company.com email, attackers can gain unauthorized access to private Slack workspaces.
4.  **System Compromise:** Through Slack, attackers may gain access to further internal systems or data through social engineering or credentials shared in Slack channels.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Email Spoofing:** The attacker crafts a spoofed email to the Zendesk support address, impersonating a user and CCing the attacker's own email.
2.  **Ticket ID Guessing/Enumeration:**  The attacker guesses/enumerates sequential ticket IDs to access various support threads.
3.  **Apple ID Creation:** The attacker creates an Apple ID using a support email address (`support@company.com`) to exploit SSO configuration in Slack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Knowledge of Zendesk Usage:** The attacker needs to know that a target company uses Zendesk for support, and how it handles support emails.
2.  **Ability to Spoof Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails with arbitrary "From" addresses to target the Zendesk instance.
3.  **Knowledge of Email Address:** The attacker must know the email address of the support account (e.g. `support@company.com`).
4.  **Access to Zendesk Support Portal**: The attacker needs to be able to submit a ticket to gain a ticket ID range to target.
5. **Basic knowledge of how OAuth flows work and how to use it to bypass Slack login security.**

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
