  "description": "The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the fieldfor, visibleParent and id parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11710\n\n**Vulnerable Software:** WP Job Portal WordPress plugin\n\n**Affected Versions:** <= 2.2.2\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters ('fieldfor', 'visibleParent', and 'id') and lack of proper preparation in the SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **SQL Injection:**  The plugin directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The vulnerability is triggered through the 'fieldfor', 'visibleParent' and 'id' parameters.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Administrator-level access.\n*   **Access:**  The attacker must have the ability to send requests that utilize the vulnerable parameters.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.3 of the plugin.\n*   The provided code diff highlights the changes made to address the vulnerability, including checks for numeric inputs and escaping. Specifically, the changes include:\n    *   `if(!is_numeric($section)){ return false; }` is added to check for numeric input of the `$section` variable in the `getResumeCustomSectionFields` function.\n    *   `if (!is_numeric($data['fieldfor'])) { return false; }` is added to check if the `fieldfor` input is numeric.\n    *   `if(is_numeric($data['visibleParent'])){...}` is added to ensure `$data['visibleParent']` input is numeric before being used in an SQL query.\n    *   `if(is_numeric($visibleParent)){...}` is added to ensure `$visibleParent` input is numeric before being used in an SQL query.\n    *   `if(!is_numeric($field)){ return false; }` is added to check if the `$field` input is numeric.\n    *   `if( is_numeric($result->section) && $result->section > 8){...}` is added to validate the `$result->section` input is numeric before executing a query.\n    *   `if (is_numeric($id) == false) return false;` and `if (is_numeric($fieldfor) == false) return false;` are added to check for numeric inputs for `$id` and `$fieldfor` respectively.\n    *   `if(isset($visibleparams['visibleParent']) && is_numeric($visibleparams['visibleParent'])){...}` is added to validate that the  `$visibleparams['visibleParent']` is numeric.\n    *   `if(!is_numeric($fieldfor)){ return false; }` is added before several queries to validate the numeric input of the `$fieldfor` variable.\n    *   `if(isset($cid) && $cid !='' && is_numeric($cid)){...}` is added to validate that the `$cid` input is numeric.\n    *   `if(isset($section) && $section !='' && is_numeric($section)){...}` is added to validate that the `$section` input is numeric.\n    *  The `~~` operator used for type coercion has been removed and `esc_sql` has been added in many places for sanitization.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the original CVE description, providing specifics about the vulnerable parameters and the fixes implemented.",

Other CWEs like CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) are more general and less specific. The relationship of CWE-89 being a child of CWE-74 reinforces this. CWE-201 is included because of the impact of the **SQL Injection**, which leads to the potential disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **SQL Injection**, which then results in potential information disclosure.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping and lack of preparation**\n*   **Weakness:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))\n*   **Impact:** CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated CVE reference. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient escaping** and a **lack of preparation** in SQL queries. This directly corresponds to CWE-89, which describes **improper neutralization** leading to **SQL Injection**. The CVE reference confirms this and provides additional details about the vulnerable parameters.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness. While other CWEs like CWE-116, CWE-352, and CWE-90 are listed, they are not as directly relevant as CWE-89. CWE-116 is related to encoding issues, which are not the primary cause here. CWE-352 is related to Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is a different type of vulnerability. CWE-90 is related to LDAP Injection, which is also not relevant.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the nature of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.\n\nCWE-201 is included as a secondary weakness to highlight the potential impact of the **SQL Injection**, which is the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- REQUIREDBY -> CWE-384\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-471\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-642\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-472\n\n*Not Used:* While this CWE relates to external control of parameters, it's not as directly relevant as CWE-89, which focuses on **SQL Injection** caused by **improper neutralization**.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-98\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-471\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-424\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-288\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-862\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is about authorization bypass, which is not the primary issue here.
