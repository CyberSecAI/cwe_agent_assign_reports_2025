## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp error out earlier on disconnect Eric reported a **division by zero** splat in the MPTCP protocol Oops divide error 0000

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **division by zero**
- **impact:** Oops
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** MPTCP protocol

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, all the content relates to the same vulnerability, a division-by-zero error in the MPTCP protocol of the Linux kernel. The vulnerability occurs due to a race condition during socket disconnection.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a race condition that can occur when a socket is disconnected while a thread is waiting for data on it via `sk_wait_data()`. Specifically, `sk_wait_data()` can return with an error and the underlying socket disconnected, leading to a zero `rcv_mss`. The code does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a division by zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Division by Zero:** The primary vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `__tcp_select_window` function due to incorrect handling of a zero `rcv_mss`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** The division-by-zero error results in a kernel panic, causing a denial of service. The system becomes unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** This vulnerability is triggered during the handling of MPTCP network traffic.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition that occurs during socket disconnection and data reception.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger a socket disconnect while the socket is in use. This is possible if the attacker has control over one of the MPTCP peers.
- The provided reproducer suggests that a user with network access could trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details from the provided diffs:**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by adding an error check to the `mptcp_recvmsg` function after calling `sk_wait_data()`. If `sk_wait_data()` returns with an error, the function now exits early, preventing the division-by-zero. Specifically:
```diff

+++ b/net/mptcp/protocol.c

 	pr_debug("block timeout %ld\n", timeo);
-	sk_wait_data(sk, &timeo, NULL);
+	mptcp_rcv_space_adjust(msk, copied);
+	err = sk_wait_data(sk, &timeo, NULL);
+	if (err < 0) {
+		err = copied ? : err;
+		goto out_err;
+	}
 }
 
+	mptcp_rcv_space_adjust(msk, copied);
+out_err:
 	if (cmsg_flags && copied >= 0) {
 		if (cmsg_flags & MPTCP_CMSG_TS)
 			mptcp_fill_timestamp(msg, &tss);
```
The key changes:
- A new `err` variable to hold the return value of `sk_wait_data()`.
- An error check `if (err < 0)`.
- If there's an error, the code jumps to the `out_err` label, where the function exits.
- If data has been copied, `copied` is returned, otherwise the error code from `sk_wait_data()` is returned.

The patch ensures that the division by zero does not occur by exiting early in case of an error returned from `sk_wait_data()`, thus handling the race condition of a disconnected socket.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1335: Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
An integer value is specified to be shifted by a negative amount or an amount greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in the value causing an unexpected or indeterminate result.

### Extended Description


Specifying a value to be shifted by a negative amount is undefined in various languages. Various computer architectures implement this action in different ways. The compilers and interpreters when generating code to accomplish a shift generally do not do a check for this issue.


Specifying an over-shift, a shift greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in a value to be shifted, produces a result which varies by architecture and compiler. In some languages, this action is specifically listed as producing an undefined result.

## CWE-369: Divide By Zero
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product divides a value by zero.

### Extended Description
This weakness typically occurs when an unexpected value is provided to the product, or if an error occurs that is not properly detected. It frequently occurs in calculations involving physical dimensions such as size, length, width, and height.

- **CVE-2007-2237:** Height value of 0 triggers divide by zero.




## CWE-1389: Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).

### Extended Description


Frequently, a numeric input that begins with "0" is treated as octal, or "0x" causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function. For example, "023" (octal) is 35 decimal, or "0x31" is 49 decimal. Other bases may be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a "0127.0.0.1" IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading "0", whose numeric value would be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use 127.0.0.1.


The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing of SSRF restrictions.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sign extension errors can lead to buffer overflows and other memory-based problems. They are also likely to be factors in other weaknesses that are not based on memory operations, but rely on numeric calculation.

**[Maintenance]** This entry is closely associated with signed-to-unsigned conversion errors (CWE-195) and other numeric errors. These relationships need to be more closely examined within CWE.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-10887:** Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-1999-0234:** Sign extension error produces -1 value that is treated as a command separator, enabling OS command injection.
- **CVE-2003-0161:** Product uses "char" type for input character. When char is implemented as a signed type, ASCII value 0xFF (255), a sign extension produces a -1 value that is treated as a program-specific separator value, effectively disabling a length check and leading to a buffer overflow. This is also a multiple interpretation error.




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft
