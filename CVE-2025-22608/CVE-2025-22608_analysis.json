CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284, representing a more specific case of improper access control where authorization is missing. CWE-639 is more specific, involving user-controlled keys, and is a child of CWE-863. The guidance suggests using more specific CWEs when possible. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing authorization** check, which makes CWE-862 the most appropriate choice as the primary weakness. CWE-639 is potentially relevant as a more specific variant, as it refers to bypassing authorization through user-controlled keys, and the vulnerability involves a predictable, incrementing ID.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which allows an authenticated user to revoke team invitations by using a predictable ID. This leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.\n\nCWE-862 (Root Cause) -> DoS (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**missing authorization**\" as the reason any authenticated user can revoke team invitations. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating, \"Missing authorization allows any authenticated user to revoke any team invitations by providing a predictable, incrementing ID.\" Based on this evidence, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as a top candidate, which reinforces this decision.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves a predictable, incrementing ID, which can be seen as a user-controlled key. However, the primary issue is the absence of an authorization check, so CWE-862 is the more direct representation of the **root cause**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 being a Class-level CWE that accurately describes the missing authorization and CWE-639 being a Base-level CWE that captures the user-controlled key aspect. The \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" section also supported this decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were

origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a
