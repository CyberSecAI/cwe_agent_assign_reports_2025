  "description": "IrfanView CGM File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24858.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files within IrfanView. Specifically, this lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient input validation when processing CGM files.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running IrfanView. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CGM file. The attacker could either trick the user into opening a malicious file or lead them to a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability via the browser if IrfanView is configured as the image viewer.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with a malicious CGM file or trick them into visiting a malicious page with the file. User interaction is required in that the user must either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing specific information on file type, attack vector, and impact.",

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered a secondary factor. CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), which is more specific but not fully applicable here.

The impact is Remote Code Execution.\n\nImproper Input Validation -> Out-of-bounds Read -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue results in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. The **root cause** is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be considered, it is discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high level of abstraction. The description does not provide enough information to map it to any child of CWE-20, such as CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The selection of CWE-125 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and its base-level specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered but not used because the vulnerability description specifically mentions an out-of-bounds *read*, not a write. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) were also considered, but the description does not specify whether the buffer is heap- or stack-based, making CWE-125 a more accurate and general representation of the vulnerability.",
