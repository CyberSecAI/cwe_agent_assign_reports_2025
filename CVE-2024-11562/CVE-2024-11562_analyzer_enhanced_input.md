## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView CGM File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24858.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files within IrfanView. Specifically, this lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient input validation when processing CGM files.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running IrfanView. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CGM file. The attacker could either trick the user into opening a malicious file or lead them to a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability via the browser if IrfanView is configured as the image viewer.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with a malicious CGM file or trick them into visiting a malicious page with the file. User interaction is required in that the user must either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
