The vulnerability description explicitly mentions command injection, and the CVE summary details RCE due to injection.

CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-77, focusing on OS commands. Since the vulnerability involves command injection leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), CWE-78 is the more accurate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a command, leading to command injection, and ultimately resulting in remote code execution.\n\nImproper Neutralization -> Command Injection -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-78 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"Command Injection\" and the CVE summary confirming \"Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to injection.\" The retriever results also list CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights the child-of relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77, favoring the more specific CWE-78. The \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\" (CWE-78) is at the optimal level of specificity.
