This maps directly to **CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**. The evidence is strong, and the confidence is high.\n\nThe Retriever Results also strongly support this mapping, with CWE-89 being the top result with a score of 1.0.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, but ultimately rejected:\n\n*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') - While this is a parent of CWE-89, CWE-89 is a more specific and appropriate classification. The vulnerability is explicitly an SQL Injection, not just a general injection.\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - This is for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, which is not the case here.\n*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This relates to file upload vulnerabilities, not relevant to SQL Injection.\n*   CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs - This relates to logging, not SQL injection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the type of injection vulnerability present.",
