  "query": "A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platforms build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.",
