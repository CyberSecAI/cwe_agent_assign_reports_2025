Given the limited information, it's difficult to determine if the exposed information is system-level (CWE-497) or personal (CWE-359). Therefore, CWE-200, while a class-level CWE, provides a fitting starting point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** The exact root cause is unknown due to lack of information, but the **impact** is **Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**.\n2.  **IMPACT:** Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states \"Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor in Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) allows an unauthorized attacker to disclose information over a network.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-200 as the top candidate, followed by CWE-497. CWE-200, despite being a class-level CWE and discouraged, directly matches the description. Without further information on the specific type of sensitive information exposed, selecting a more specific child CWE like CWE-497 or CWE-359 would be speculative.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) could be a secondary candidate if the exposed information is system-related. However, without more specific details, it is difficult to justify selecting it over the general CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
