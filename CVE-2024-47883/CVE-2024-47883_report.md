# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47883

## Description

The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works opening a connection to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the apps codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the servers filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (**server-side request forgery** with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser (**cross-site scripting**). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (**remote code execution**). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-22** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). This is because the application **does not properly neutralize special elements** within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

The secondary weaknesses are:

*   **CWE-918** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because the application fetches a file from a remote machine as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase.
*   **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') because an attacker can cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser.
*   **CWE-1336** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine because an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-22** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). This leads to:

1.  An attacker gaining access to files on the server's filesystem or shared by nearby machines (**CWE-22**, **CWE-918**).
2.  An attacker causing arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser (**CWE-79**).
3.  An attacker causing the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (**CWE-1336**), leading to remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and keyphrase-specific CWE analysis. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application **does not properly neutralize special elements** within the pathname, which is a key characteristic of **CWE-22**. The description also mentions the possibility of server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and remote code execution, which are related to **CWE-918**, **CWE-79**, and **CWE-1336**, respectively.

The graph relationships confirm that **CWE-22** is the primary weakness, as it is the root cause of the other vulnerabilities. The other CWEs are secondary weaknesses that result from the **improper limitation of a pathname**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.

The other CWEs from **Complete CWE Specifications** were considered but not used because they were not as directly related to the vulnerability description. For example, **CWE-502** Deserialization of Untrusted Data was considered, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description does not mention deserialization.

**CWE-41** Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.

**CWE-74** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') was not selected because it is high-level and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.

**CWE-184** Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

**CWE-138** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements was not selected because it is a Class and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.

**CWE-80** Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) was not selected because the description refers to arbitrary javascript injection, meaning it's not basic XSS.

**CWE-23** Relative Path Traversal was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes relative path traversal.

**CWE-451** User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to UI misrepresentation.

**CWE-113** Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.

**CWE-668** Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere was not selected because it is high-level and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.

**CWE-472** External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to external control of assumed-immutable web parameters.

**CWE-28** Path Traversal: '..\filedir' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.

**CWE-24** Path Traversal: '../filedir' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.

**CWE-29** Path Traversal: '\..\filename' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.

**CWE-78** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') was not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to OS command injection.

**CWE-98** Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') was not selected because the vulnerability is not specific to PHP.

**CWE-94** Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') was not selected because **CWE-1336** is more appropriate.

**CWE-427** Uncontrolled Search Path Element was not selected because it is less directly related to the vulnerability than other candidates, although a case could be made for its inclusion.
