CWE-352 is a compound weakness. CWE-79 is a base weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**, which allows an attacker to force a user to make unintended requests. If the application **fails to neutralize input** properly, as described by **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**, it results in stored XSS. The **root cause** is the **lack of CSRF protection**, which then enables the stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states a **CSRF [Cross-Site Request Forgery]** vulnerability that leads to **Stored XSS**. The primary CWE is CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] because the **CSRF** vulnerability is the **root cause** that allows the XSS to be exploited. The XSS is a consequence of the **CSRF**, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts via a forged request.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as top candidates. While CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] describes the XSS part of the vulnerability, CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] better captures the **root cause**, as the XSS is triggered through a **CSRF** attack.\n\nThe description mentions that the **CSRF** vulnerability allows for **Stored XSS**, indicating that a successful **CSRF** attack can lead to the injection and storage of malicious scripts on the server, which are then executed when other users access the affected functionality.\n\nTherefore, CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is the primary CWE, and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a secondary CWE describing the resulting **Stored XSS** vulnerability. Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
