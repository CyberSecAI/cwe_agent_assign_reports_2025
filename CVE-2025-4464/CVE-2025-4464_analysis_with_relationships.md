# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-4464

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. There are no parent-child or chain relationships that were relevant in this specific case, as the description directly points to an SQL Injection vulnerability. Abstraction level was considered, and the Base level of CWE-89 was appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input leading directly to **SQL Injection**.
  - The root cause is the **lack of proper input validation or sanitization**.
  - The impact is the ability to inject malicious SQL code.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the key phrase "**sql injection**" in the vulnerability description. This directly corresponds to CWE-89, "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')." The retriever results also strongly support this classification, with CWE-89 having a score of 1.0. The base level of abstraction is suitable as it directly describes the weakness.

The decision is further supported by the fact that there is no information available from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section which suggests that the rootcause is due to **sql injection**.

Other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) were considered based on the retriever results but were deemed not applicable as the vulnerability description clearly states **SQL Injection** as the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
