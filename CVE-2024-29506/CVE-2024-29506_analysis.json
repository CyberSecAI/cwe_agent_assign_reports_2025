The size of the filter name (`n->length`) is controlled by the attacker, which causes a buffer overflow if the filter name is larger than 100 bytes.\n*   **Vulnerability:** Unchecked `memcpy` into a stack buffer.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow which could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a filter name larger than 100 bytes in length. The `-dPDFDEBUG` flag must also be enabled to trigger the vulnerable code path.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDF file to Ghostscript and control the command line arguments to enable the `-dPDFDEBUG` flag.\n\n**Summary of relevant details:**\n* The vulnerability is located in `pdfi_apply_filter` within the Ghostscript PDF interpreter.\n* It is triggered when the `-dPDFDEBUG` flag is enabled.\n* A `memcpy` copies an attacker-controlled filter name into a 100-byte stack buffer without any size checks.\n* The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PDF file.\n* This vulnerability was fixed in Ghostscript version 10.03.0.",

CWE-120 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), forming a potential chain. The abstraction levels guided the selection of CWE-121 as the most specific and appropriate choice, and CWE-119 is a more general class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input (filter name). This leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow**, where data is written beyond the boundaries of a stack-allocated buffer. The overflow can then lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key indicator is the **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `pdfi_apply_filter()` function due to a long PDF filter name. This directly aligns with CWE-121. The CVE reference summary confirms that the code copies the PDF filter name into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow if the filter name is larger than 100 bytes.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationship between CWE-121 and CWE-119, which supports the choice of CWE-121 as the more specific and relevant CWE. The chain relationship with CWE-120 indicates a potential vulnerability chain.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-121 precisely describes the type of buffer overflow (stack-based), while CWE-119 is a more general class that encompasses various memory buffer issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
