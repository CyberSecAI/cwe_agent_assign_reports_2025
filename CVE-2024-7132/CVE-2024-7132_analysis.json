  "description": "The Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks WordPress plugin before 3.1.13 does not escape the content of post embed via one of its block, which could allow users with the capability to publish posts (editor and admin by default) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly escape content when embedding posts, specifically when using the \"Post Carousel (CoBlocks)\" or \"Posts (CoBlocks)\" blocks.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied content, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when the affected block is rendered.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection. This can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled, making it more severe in multisite setups.\n- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the capability to publish posts (Editor role or higher) creates a post with malicious code (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) and publishes it. When a user adds a \"Post Carousel (CoBlocks)\" or \"Posts (CoBlocks)\" block to a page or post, the stored XSS is triggered when the malicious content is rendered.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Editor role permissions or higher on the WordPress site, meaning they have the ability to create and publish posts.",

The plugin does not neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in output used as a web page. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a Base level CWE. There are many child CWEs, but they are not specific enough for this vulnerability. The retriever results also suggest CWE-79 as a possible match, and this is supported by the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the plugin failing to properly escape content when embedding posts. This leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker with the capability to publish posts can inject malicious code, which is then executed when the affected block is rendered.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin does not escape the content of post embeds, which allows for Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the plugin fails to properly escape content when embedding posts, and that this can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\nCWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity. While there are child CWEs, they are not specific enough to accurately represent the vulnerability.
