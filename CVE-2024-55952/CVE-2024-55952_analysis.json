  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55952:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the insecure construction of JDBC connection strings within the Dataease application, specifically in the `RedshiftConfiguration` class. The application does not properly sanitize or filter user-supplied parameters when creating the JDBC URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious parameters into the connection string, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-provided parameters, specifically the `host` parameter in the JDBC connection string.\n- **JDBC URL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious parameters like `socketFactory` and `socketFactoryArg` into the JDBC URL.\n- **Insecure Deserialization:** By injecting `socketFactory=org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` and `socketFactoryArg` pointing to a malicious XML configuration file, attackers can trigger the construction method of `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Dataease application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is launched through HTTP requests. The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/datasource/validate/` endpoint, containing malicious parameters in the JSON payload.\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Dataease application to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Dataease system.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Dataease server.\n- **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to control a server to host a malicious XML configuration file, referenced by the `socketFactoryArg` parameter.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided code examples show the vulnerable code and the malicious XML file used for RCE.\n- The vulnerability is located in the `io.dataease.dto.datasource.RedshiftConfiguration` class.\n- The commit `0db4872a52eccf6e83dd9359aa05db52dd580ec1` fixes the vulnerability by adding a list of illegal parameters and checking the JDBC URL string for them.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- **Upgrade:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.18.27. It's highly recommended to upgrade to this version or later.\n- **Input Validation:** Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection of malicious parameters into JDBC connection strings.\n- **Parameter Blacklisting:** The fix implements a blacklisting approach to prevent usage of specific parameters in the connection string.\n\nThis vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Dataease. The fix involves sanitizing the JDBC connection string by blacklisting known dangerous parameters.",

CWE-74 is a Class level CWE, representing a more general category of injection vulnerabilities. CWE-89 (SQL Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) are siblings of CWE-917, as they are all children of CWE-74. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-917 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability, as it directly addresses the use of expression language injection. The evidence from the CVE description supports this choice, as it mentions the use of `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which is related to expression language statements.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe89,cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the JDBC connection string (CWE-917). This leads to the ability to inject malicious parameters, which then allows for remote code execution. The chain can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-917)**: The application fails to validate user-supplied parameters in the JDBC connection string.\n2.  **Expression Language Injection**: Attackers inject malicious parameters into the JDBC URL using expression language.\n3.  **Remote Code Execution**: The injected code is executed on the server, leading to complete system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the **Vulnerability Description** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, strongly suggests CWE-917 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability involves the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an expression language statement, specifically within the JDBC connection string. The attacker can inject malicious parameters, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states that the root cause is due to the insecure construction of JDBC connection strings where the application \"does not properly sanitize or filter user-supplied parameters when creating the JDBC URL\" and this allows injection of \"malicious parameters like `socketFactory` and `socketFactoryArg` into the JDBC URL.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to select CWE-917, as it is the most specific CWE that addresses the use of expression language injection. While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a parent CWE, it is too broad and does not capture the specific nature of the vulnerability. CWE-89 (SQL Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) were also considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability does not directly involve SQL or OS commands.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weakness and provide valuable information for mitigation and prevention.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation for CWE-917:*\n\nThe vulnerability in DataEase allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious parameters into the JDBC connection string. This is achieved by **improperly neutralizing** special elements in the expression language statement used to construct the JDBC URL. Specifically, the `socketFactory` and `socketFactoryArg` parameters can be manipulated to trigger the construction method of `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, leading to remote code execution.\n\n*Security Implications and Potential Impact:*\n\nThe security implication of this vulnerability is severe, as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DataEase application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.\n\n*Parent-Child Relationships and Chain Patterns:*\n\nCWE-917 is a child of CWE-74, which represents a more general category of injection vulnerabilities.

The usage is allowed, and the description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's characteristics.\n\n*Technical Explanation for CWE-74:*\n\nCWE-74 represents the **improper neutralization** of special elements in output used by a downstream component. In the context of this vulnerability, the JDBC connection string is the output that is being sent to the downstream component (the database). The attacker is able to inject malicious parameters into this string because the application does not properly neutralize special elements.\n\n*Security Implications and Potential Impact:*\n\nThe security implications of CWE-74 are that an attacker can manipulate the downstream component by injecting malicious code or commands. In this case, the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DataEase application.\n\n*Parent-Child Relationships and Chain Patterns:*\n\nCWE-74 is a class-level CWE and has many child CWEs, including CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), CWE-89 (SQL Injection), and CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). The chain pattern involves **improper neutralization** (CWE-74) leading to remote code execution.\n\n*MITRE Mapping Guidance Influence:*\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-74 states that it is discouraged because it is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate. However, it is still relevant in this case as a secondary CWE because it captures the general nature of the injection vulnerability.\n\n*Technical Explanation for CWE-89:*\n\nCWE-89 represents the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. While the vulnerability does not directly involve SQL commands, the JDBC connection string is used to connect to a database, and the attacker is able to inject malicious parameters into this string.\n\n*Security Implications and Potential Impact:*\n\nThe security implications of CWE-89 are that an attacker can manipulate the SQL commands that are executed on the database. In this case, the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DataEase application.\n\n*Parent-Child Relationships and Chain Patterns:*\n\nCWE-89 is a child of CWE-74. The chain pattern involves **improper neutralization** (CWE-89) potentially leading to SQL injection and further compromise.\n\n*MITRE Mapping Guidance Influence:*\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-89 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes.
