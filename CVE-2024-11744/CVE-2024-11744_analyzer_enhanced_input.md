- **vector:** manipulation of the argument name
- **product:** 1000 Projects Portfolio Management System
- **version:** MCA 1.0
- **component:** /register.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `/register.php` file of the "Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL".
- The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `name` parameter, before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, which occurs when user-supplied data is incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or filter the `name` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers could retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In some cases, an attacker might gain broader control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability can be exploited to disrupt the availability or functionality of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/register.php`, specifically through the vulnerable `name` parameter.
- **Malicious SQL Payload:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
- **HTTP Request Forging:** The attacker must be able to forge HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL code in the `name` parameter.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information states that no login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning that it can be exploited by anyone with network access to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details**

- Vulnerable File: `/register.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `name` (POST)
- Proof of Concept (POC) Payload:
   ```
    name=11111111' AND (SELECT 8175 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))WeiB) AND 'PnLh'='PnLh&email=12@qq.com&passwd=11111111111111111111111&submit=Next
   ```
- sqlmap command used to identify vulnerability:
    ```
    sqlmap -u "10.211.55.6:1114/register.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=n4bccomqe6pevr8e66un0bsu12" --data=name="11111111&email=12%40qq.com&passwd=11111111111111111111111&submit=Next" --batch --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=mysql --random-agent --dbs
    ```

**Suggested Repair:**
- **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input data.
- **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering on user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Minimize database user permissions for the account used by the application to connect to the database.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability, its potential impact, and remediation measures.
