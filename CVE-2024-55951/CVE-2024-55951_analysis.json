  "description": "Metabase is an open-source data analytics platform. For new sandboxing configurations created in 1.52.0 till 1.52.2.4, sandboxed users are able to see field filter values from other sandboxed users. This is fixed in 1.52.2.5. Users on 1.52.0 or 1.52.1 or 1.5.2 should upgrade to 1.52.2.5. There are no workarounds for this issue aside from upgrading.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Field filter values for the first sandboxed user are cached, and subsequent sandboxed users are able to see these cached values. This is due to improper caching mechanisms when handling field filters in sandboxed environments.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows sandboxed users to view filter values from other sandboxed users, which should be isolated.\n    *   **Improper caching:** The caching mechanism does not properly account for sandboxed user contexts, leading to cross-user data leakage.\n\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   **Confidentiality breach:**  The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of filter values between sandboxed users. This is classified as a low confidentiality impact on the subsequent system because the leaked data is likely related to filtering and does not directly expose the system's full data.\n    *   No impact on integrity and availability according to the provided information.\n\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as it involves interaction with a web application.\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   **Low privileges:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account (sandboxed user account).\n    *   **Active user interaction:** A user is required to interact with the system for this vulnerability to be triggered. This suggests a scenario where a user will apply a filter that will be cached for another user to see.\n\n**CVSS Metrics:**\n\nThe provided CVSS v4 vector string `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N` breaks down as:\n\n*   **AV:N (Attack Vector: Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.\n*  **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** No special conditions are needed to exploit this vulnerability\n*   **AT:N (Attack Requirements: None):** No specific attack prerequisites are required.\n*   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** An attacker needs a low-privileged account.\n*   **UI:A (User Interaction: Active):** The vulnerability requires user interaction (another user applying the filter to be leaked).\n*   **VC:N (Vulnerable System Confidentiality: None):** No confidentiality impact on the directly affected vulnerable system.\n*   **VI:N (Vulnerable System Integrity: None):** No integrity impact on the directly affected vulnerable system.\n*   **VA:N (Vulnerable System Availability: None):** No availability impact on the directly affected vulnerable system.\n*   **SC:L (Subsequent System Confidentiality: Low):** Low confidentiality impact on the subsequent system, as leaked filter data isn't considered highly sensitive.\n*   **SI:N (Subsequent System Integrity: None):** No integrity impact on the subsequent system.\n*   **SA:N (Subsequent System Availability: None):** No availability impact on the subsequent system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is specific to the Enterprise version of Metabase.\n*   The issue affects versions 1.52.0 up to 1.52.2.4 and is fixed in 1.52.2.5.\n*   No workarounds exist besides upgrading to the patched version.\n*   The advisory suggests using Metabase's audit feature to identify potential user impact.",

There are no clear chain relationships indicated in the vulnerability description. Abstraction levels guide selection towards the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe525[\"CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe525 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe525 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper caching** of field filter values, leading to **information disclosure** when other sandboxed users access these cached values.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper Caching (Implicit)\n  - **Weakness:** **Information Disclosure** due to cached data being accessible to unauthorized users.\n  - **Impact:** Other sandboxed users can see field filter values from other sandboxed users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-200 as a possible candidate due to the **information disclosure** aspect. However, the root cause analysis and more specific retriever results pointed towards CWE-525. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary clearly indicates that the vulnerability occurs because sensitive information is being exposed due to the use of the web browser cache. Since the field filter values for the first sandboxed user are cached, and subsequent sandboxed users are able to see these cached values, CWE-525 is the most appropriate mapping.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by emphasizing the need for a more specific CWE than CWE-200. CWE-525 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the caching mechanism weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
