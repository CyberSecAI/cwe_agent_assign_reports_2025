  "query": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface discloses sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to elevate privileges from guest to admin.",
