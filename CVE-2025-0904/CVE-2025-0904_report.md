# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0904

## Description

PDF-XChange Editor XPS File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XPS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25422.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read']
- **Impact:** ['execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process', 'disclose sensitive information', 'Information Disclosure']
- **Vector:** visit a malicious page or open a malicious file
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Product:** PDF-XChange Editor
- **Component:** XPS File Parsing

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, which occurs due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, suggesting a relationship with CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**.
CWE-125 is a base CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.
CWE-20 is a class CWE, and is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** (CWE-125), and resulting in **Information Disclosure**.
- **Root Cause:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation
- **Weakness:** CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read
- **Impact:** Information Disclosure

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** and CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** as the primary candidates. The vulnerability description clearly states "**Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**" and mentions that the issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.

The Retriever results and keyphrase analysis also pointed towards these CWEs. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability, CWE-125 is selected as the primary CWE because it describes the specific **out-of-bounds read** condition. CWE-20 is added as a secondary CWE due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** aspect of the root cause.

The selection of CWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).
