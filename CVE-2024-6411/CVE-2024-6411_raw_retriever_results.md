# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-6411
## Query
The ProfileGrid - User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.9. This is due to a lack of validation on user-supplied data in the pm_upload_image AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their user capabilities to Administrator.

## Keyphrases
