It lists numerous updates and fixes released between 2015 and 2025. Several entries specifically mention security-related fixes:\\n\\n*   **7.5** (Apr 7 2025): \"Fixed parameter sanitizing in ssf-tracking function to enhance security\"\\n*   **7.1** (Jan 24 2025): \"Fixed parameter sanitizing issue in ssf-social-action.php ([Reviews and Ratings Add-on](https://codecanyon.net/item/social-store-locator-reviews-ratings-addon/16651590)) + Fixed minor vulnerability security issue above only if you own Reviews and Ratings Add-on\"\\n*   **6.9.8** (Aug 14 2024): \"Updated Sanitization for Admin Store and Admin Listing Page + Updated Sanitization for Request Add Store Page\"\\n*   **6.2** (Oct 22 2020): \"Fixed plugin Vulnerability post Penetration Test\"\\n*   **6.4** (Mar 9 2021): \"Fixed SQL Injection related to minor search query\"\\n*   **1.7.1** (Jun 25 2015): \"Updated Pretty Photo libraries to 3.1.6 due to security vulnerabilities\"\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe patch notes indicate several root causes, including insufficient parameter sanitization, potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, and outdated libraries with known security flaws (Pretty Photo).\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n*   Parameter sanitization issues (multiple instances)\\n*   SQL Injection (minor search query)\\n*   Outdated libraries (Pretty Photo)\\n*   General plugin vulnerabilities identified through penetration testing.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nThe impact varies depending on the vulnerability. It could range from unauthorized access or modification of data (due to SQL injection or parameter sanitization issues) to potential remote code execution if the penetration test revealed more severe flaws.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n*   Exploitation of unsanitized parameters in `ssf-tracking` and `ssf-social-action.php`.\\n*   Crafted SQL queries targeting the search functionality.\\n*   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the outdated Pretty Photo library.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n*   An attacker would need to be able to send crafted requests to the WordPress plugin.\\n*   For SQL injection, the attacker would need knowledge of the database structure.\\n*   For exploiting the outdated library, the attacker would need to be able to access the vulnerable code.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\nThe provided content *is* the mitigation/fix \u2013 applying the updates to the Super Store Finder for WordPress plugin as they were released.
