# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-13440

# Vulnerability Description

    The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ssf_wp_user_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into an already existing query to store **cross-site scripting** in store reviews.
