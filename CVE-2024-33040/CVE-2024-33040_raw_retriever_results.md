# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-33040

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-33040
## Query
Memory corruption while invoking redundant release command to release one buffer from user space as race condition can occur in kernel space between buffer release and buffer access.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'race condition'
- **weakness**: 'Memory corruption'
