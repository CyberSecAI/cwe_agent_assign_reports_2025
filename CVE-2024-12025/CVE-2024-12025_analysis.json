  "description": "The Collapsing Categories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the taxonomy parameter of the /wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get REST API in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation within the Collapsing Categories WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `taxonomy` parameter within the `/wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get` REST API endpoint is not adequately handled.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `taxonomy` parameter received through the REST API before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-supplied data, specifically the `taxonomy` parameter, is not sufficiently sanitized or escaped before being incorporated into a database query.\n*   **Insufficient Query Preparation:** The existing SQL query lacks sufficient preparation, making it susceptible to manipulation via injected SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database by injecting malicious SQL queries designed to reveal database contents.\n*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could also allow attackers to perform other database related attacks, potentially gaining control of the website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **REST API Endpoint:** The attack vector is the `/wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get` REST API endpoint.\n*   **`taxonomy` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `taxonomy` parameter passed to the REST API.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning no prior access to the website is required.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress website to send requests to the REST API endpoint.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Collapsing Categories plugin up to and including 3.0.8.\n*   The patched version is 3.0.9, which addresses this SQL injection issue by removing the REST API.\n*   The provided changeset on the WordPress plugins repository ([plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3201979%40collapsing-categories&new=3201979%40collapsing-categories&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=)) shows the removal of the vulnerable REST API endpoint.\n* The Wordfence article provides more detail than the basic CVE description.",

Given the explicit mention of **SQL Injection** as the weakness and the root cause being **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, CWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate choice. While other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-90 (LDAP Injection) were considered due to their presence in the Retriever Results and graph relationships, they were deemed less relevant as the vulnerability is clearly an SQL Injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Dynamic SQL Query\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74,cwe138 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **SQL Injection** and ultimately resulting in the ability to **extract sensitive information from the database**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\nWeakness: **SQL Injection** (CWE-89)\nImpact: Sensitive Data Exposure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the explicit description of the vulnerability as an **SQL Injection** due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient query preparation**.
