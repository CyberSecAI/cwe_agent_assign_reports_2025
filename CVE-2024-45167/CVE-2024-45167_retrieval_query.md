# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-45167

# Vulnerability Description

    An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Due to **improper input validation**, **improper **deserialization****, and **improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer**, IDOL2 is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and possibly remote code execution. A certain XmlMessage document causes 100% CPU consumption.
