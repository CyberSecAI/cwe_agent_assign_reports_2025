This is because when the control flow goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from (i-1)th iteration are freed. Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-415 CWE-789 CWE-403 CWE-401 CWE-805 CWE-770 CWE-362 CWE-909",
