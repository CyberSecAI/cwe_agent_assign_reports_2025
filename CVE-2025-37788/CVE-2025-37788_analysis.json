  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cxgb4 fix **memory leak** in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a **memory leak** is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds, but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from (i-1)th iteration are freed. Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.",

No other CWEs were identified as being related in a parent-child or peer relationship that would influence the selection of CWE-401. The focus is directly on the **memory leak** due to a missing release of memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **memory leak** occurs because memory is allocated but not freed under certain error conditions.\n  - **Root Cause:** Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (CWE-401)\n  - **Impact:** Resource exhaustion due to the **memory leak**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **memory leak** occurs in the `cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters()` function within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue arises in a loop where memory is allocated for `loc_array` and `bmap`. If allocation for `loc_array` succeeds but allocation for `bmap` fails, the code jumps to a cleanup label (`free_eth_finfo`). However, the cleanup only frees allocations from the (i-1)th iteration onwards, leading to a **memory leak** in the current iteration.\n\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime). This CWE accurately describes the root cause, as the allocated memory is not properly released when the `bmap` allocation fails.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" section lists several CWEs, with CWE-401 having the highest score. This further validates the selection of CWE-401.\n\nOther CWEs considered:\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): While memory allocation is involved, the core issue isn't the size of the allocation but the failure to release it.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): This is not the correct CWE as the issue is not about limits or throttling.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): The issue is not related to double freeing the same memory.\n\nThe choice of CWE-401 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. The evidence directly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
