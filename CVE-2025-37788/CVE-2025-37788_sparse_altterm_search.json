  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cxgb4 fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds, but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from (i-1)th iteration are freed. Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.",
