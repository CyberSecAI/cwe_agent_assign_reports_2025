The primary indicator is the phrase \"trigger a pipeline as another user,\" which suggests an authorization issue.\n\nThe retriever results point to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). CWE-285 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-639 is a base-level CWE. Due to the lack of specific details about the authorization bypass mechanism, CWE-285 is selected as the primary CWE, representing the general **improper authorization**.\n\nCWE-639 is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that an attacker can trigger a pipeline as another user, which could be achieved by modifying a key value identifying the user.
