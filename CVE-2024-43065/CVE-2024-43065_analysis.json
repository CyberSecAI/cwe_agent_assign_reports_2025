CWE-327 is a Class, and while ideally a Base or Variant CWE would be preferred, the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description makes it difficult to narrow down the selection further. CWE-330 is also a Class, and is related to CWE-327 through potential usage in cryptographic algorithms.
