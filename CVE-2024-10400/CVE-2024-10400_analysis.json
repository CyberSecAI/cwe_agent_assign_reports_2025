  "description": "The Tutor LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the rating_filter parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10400\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `rating_filter` parameter within the Tutor LMS plugin's SQL queries. Additionally, there is a lack of proper preparation of the SQL query.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.\n- While the provided information does not specify other impacts, SQL injection vulnerabilities could potentially lead to data modification or complete compromise of the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.\n- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.\n- The `rating_filter` parameter is the specific entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.\n- No prior authentication or elevated privileges are required.\n- The attacker must be able to send requests that include the `rating_filter` parameter.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Tutor LMS plugin up to and including 2.7.6.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.7 of the Tutor LMS plugin.\n- The provided changelog from the plugin's Trac repository indicates the update was to address \"Security vulnerabilities\".\n- The Wordfence description provides the CVSS score of 7.5, which is considered \"High\".\n- The patch involved changes to the `Utils.php` file, specifically related to how the `rating_having` SQL clause is prepared. It was modified to use `$wpdb->prepare` to prevent SQL Injection. Additionally, a check for the `users_can_register` option has been added in `Instructor.php` in the `register_instructor()` function, preventing registration if the option is not enabled, likely as a secondary security enhancement.",

It's also a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic), but CWE-89 is more specific to SQL, making it a better fit. There are no relevant chain relationships to consider.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads to **SQL Injection**, which can then be exploited to extract sensitive information from the database, resulting in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the key phrases \"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\" and \"SQL injection\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary describing the root cause as insufficient escaping leading to SQL injection and information disclosure. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**. Other CWEs like CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) are more general and less specific to SQL.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

Other CWEs like CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) are more general and less specific to SQL.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
