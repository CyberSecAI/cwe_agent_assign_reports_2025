  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/jfs Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 2TB aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined behavior and improper AG sizing. On 32-bit architectures - Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow - This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in sbi->bmap->db_agsize - Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures - Could lead to - Filesystem corruption during extend operations - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures Fix by casting to s64 before shifting bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in JFS block calculation code. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
