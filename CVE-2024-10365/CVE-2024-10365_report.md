# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-10365

## Description

The The Plus Addons for Elementor Elementor Addons, Page Templates, Widgets, Mega Menu, WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.3 via the render function in modules/widgets/tp_carousel_anything.php, modules/widgets/tp_page_scroll.php, and other widgets. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft template data.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** Sensitive Information Exposure
- **Impact:** extract sensitive template data
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **Product:** Plus Addons for Elementor
- **Version:** up to and including 6.0.3
- **Component:** ["['render function in modules/widgets/tp_carousel_anything.php'", "'modules/widgets/tp_page_scroll.php'", "'other widgets']"]

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200), where the application unintentionally reveals sensitive data to unauthorized actors. A contributing factor is likely **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862), where the system fails to properly restrict access to the template data based on user roles. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-862 is also a Class-level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with a **lack of proper authorization checks** (**Missing Authorization**, CWE-862) when rendering Elementor templates. This **failure to restrict access** leads directly to **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200), where private, pending, or draft template data becomes accessible to authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200). The plugin does not properly restrict access to template data, leading to unauthorized exposure. This is further compounded by the fact that contributors and above can access this information, where they should not.

The analysis is heavily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase "**Sensitive Information Exposure**" and the description of the impact (extracting sensitive template data) strongly suggest CWE-200. The fact that authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access can perform the exploit implies a problem with authorization, suggesting CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**.

The graph relationships show that CWE-862 can precede CWE-200, supporting the idea that a missing authorization check leads to sensitive information exposure.

CWE-200 is chosen because it directly describes the **weakness**: the exposure of sensitive data. CWE-862 is chosen as a secondary CWE because it explains the **root cause**: the authorization checks are missing.

The selection of CWE-200 and CWE-862 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Class) given the available evidence.
