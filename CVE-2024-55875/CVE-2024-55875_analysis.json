Prior to version 5.41.0.0, there is a potential **XXE** (XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability when http4k handling malicious XML contents within requests, which might allow attackers to read local sensitive information on server, trigger **Server-side Request Forgery** and even execute code under some circumstances. Version 5.41.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-55875:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the insecure configuration of the `DocumentBuilderFactory` used for parsing XML in the `http4k` library. Specifically, the default configuration allows external entities to be resolved and expanded during XML parsing.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the presence of an XXE injection point. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` was instantiated without disabling external entity resolution. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious XML content with references to external entities, which could then be processed by the server.\n- The code in `Xml.kt` directly uses `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()` which, by default, allows external entity resolution.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially read local files and sensitive information on the server by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.\n- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could trigger SSRF by making the server perform HTTP requests to internal or external resources controlled by the attacker.\n- **Potential Code Execution:** In specific environments, XXE vulnerabilities can potentially lead to remote code execution, although this is not a certainty, it is a risk.\n- The provided PoC demonstrates how a malicious XML payload can cause a server to make an external request.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests containing malicious XML payloads, sent to endpoints that use the vulnerable `http4k` XML parsing functionality.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.\n- No authentication or specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attacker needs to know how to construct malicious XML payloads containing external entity references.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability using a curl command that triggers an SSRF.\n- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling external entity resolution in the `DocumentBuilderFactory` by default, using `isExpandEntityReferences = false` and setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to empty strings.\n- The fix involved adding a `XmlParsingConfig` type and applying security settings to the `DocumentBuilderFactory`.\n- The vulnerable code is located in `core/format/xml/src/main/kotlin/org/http4k/format/Xml.kt` in the `asXmlDocument()` function, where the `DocumentBuilderFactory` was created.\n- The fix is available in versions `5.41.0.0` and `4.50.0.0` of `http4k`.\n- The provided code snippet shows that the fix included a `defaultXmlParsingConfig` that disables entity expansion and external DTD and schema access, which is then used by the XML parsing methods.\n- A test case (`XmlSecurityTest.kt`) was created to ensure external entities are not resolved or loaded.\n- The vulnerability was assigned a critical severity rating with a CVSS score of 9.8.\n- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-200, CWE-611, and CWE-918.\n\nIn summary, the content provides a comprehensive description of an XXE vulnerability in the `http4k` library, including the root cause, impact, attack vector, and how it was resolved.",

This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML, leading to potential **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918)**, the ability to **read local sensitive information (CWE-200)**, and potentially execute code.\n  - The **root cause** is the **improper** handling of XML entities (**CWE-611**).\n  - This leads to the **impact** of SSRF (**CWE-918**), Information Disclosure (**CWE-200**), and potentially Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is **CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the potential for **XXE** when handling malicious XML content. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-611, which states that the product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control. The resulting impacts, such as **Server-side Request Forgery** and reading local sensitive information, further support this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-611 as the most relevant CWE, with a high score across different keyphrases (ROOTCAUSE, WEAKNESS, IMPACT, VECTOR, ATTACKER, PRODUCT, VERSION). The relationships confirm that CWE-611 can lead to CWE-918 and CWE-200.\n\nThe selection of CWE-611 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper** handling of XML external entities. While higher-level CWEs like CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) could apply, CWE-611 provides a more precise and actionable classification.\n\nCWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) is a secondary weakness because it is a potential outcome of the **XXE** vulnerability. If the **improper** handling of XML allows external entities to make requests to internal resources, it results in SSRF. Similarly, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a secondary weakness because the **XXE** vulnerability can be exploited to read local files containing sensitive information.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')): While related to XML vulnerabilities, this CWE focuses on recursive entity definitions, which is not the primary issue described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): This CWE is not directly related to the **XXE** vulnerability described.\n*   CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data): This CWE is relevant to deserialization issues, not XML parsing.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This CWE is related to template engines, which is not the focus of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel): While it relates to communication channels, it is not the primary issue.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): This is relevant to SQL injection, not XML parsing.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-611 as the primary CWE, with CWE-918 and CWE-200 as secondary weaknesses.",
