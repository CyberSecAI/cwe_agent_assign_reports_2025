# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47191

## Vulnerability Description
pam_oath.so in oath-toolkit 2.6.7 through 2.6.11 before 2.6.12 allows root privilege escalation because, in the context of PAM code running as root, it **mishandles usersfile access**, such as by calling fchown in the presence of a symlink.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `pam_oath.so` PAM module and its associated `liboath` library, specifically the `oath_authenticate_usersfile()` function, which handles the reading and writing of the usersfile. The core issue lies in the usage of `fopen("w")` to create lock and new files without verifying the path, allowing symbolic links to be followed, coupled with not dropping privileges when accessing user-controlled paths. This allows for arbitrary file overwrites when `${HOME}` is used in the `usersfile` configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Pattern:** Although not a classic race condition, using `fopen("w")` on a path controlled by the user allows the user to manipulate the path between the time the path is "checked" and when it is opened for writing.
*   **Unsafe File Operations:** The code uses `fopen()` with "w" mode, which truncates existing files, and follows symlinks.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The PAM module runs as root, and the vulnerable code doesn't drop privileges before operating on user-controlled files.
*   **Insecure Lockfile Handling:** The lockfile is created using `fopen("w")`, which can overwrite existing symlinks, and then deleted after usage which could lead to race conditions with other processes.
*   **Lack of Path Sanitization:**  The code does not properly validate or sanitize file paths, allowing the usage of `${HOME}` to access arbitrary files.
*   **Insecure File Ownership:**  After writing the temporary file it uses `fchown()` to set the file ownership, which when combined with the ability to write to any file via a symlink allows a user to change the ownership of arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user can overwrite arbitrary files, including critical system files like `/etc/shadow`, gaining root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Users can overwrite the content of any file they can create a symlink to.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Users might be able to prevent the PAM module from obtaining necessary locks, causing denial of service.
*   **Data Corruption:**  By overwriting critical files, an attacker can cause data corruption or instability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** A malicious user creates a symbolic link (e.g., `ln -s /etc/shadow $HOME/user.oath.new`) pointing to a privileged file in the user's home directory.
*   **Vulnerable Configuration:** The `pam_oath.so` module is configured with `usersfile=${HOME}/some/path`, which makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
*   **Ability to Create Symlinks:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links in their home directory (or any path used in `usersfile` that is under their control)
*   **PAM Authentication Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger a PAM authentication attempt that uses the vulnerable `pam_oath.so` module (e.g., by logging in via a service configured to use the pam_oath.so module).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** OATH Toolkit `pam_oath` and `liboath` versions 2.6.7 to 2.6.11 are affected.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in OATH Toolkit version 2.6.12.
*   **Mitigation:** Applying the patch from version 2.6.12 or the SUSE patch (with added hardening) to earlier versions will prevent exploitation.
*   **SUSE Patch:** The SUSE patch includes additional hardening, such as using the `*at` family of system calls, dropping privileges to the file owner and using the usersfile itself for locking. It is less portable as it utilizes Linux-specific features.
*   **Upstream Patch:** The upstream patch aims for portability and uses `fopen(wx)` to prevent opening of existing files. It also drops privileges to the PAM user being authenticated.
*   **`fopen(wx)`:** The upstream fix uses `fopen(wx)`, which is an exclusive create mode, preventing the overwrite of a symlink. It utilizes gnulib for cross-platform support of `fopen(wx)`.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of secure file handling, especially in privileged contexts, and the risks associated with using user-provided paths without proper validation. The use of  `fopen("w")` is also problematic and should be avoided.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
