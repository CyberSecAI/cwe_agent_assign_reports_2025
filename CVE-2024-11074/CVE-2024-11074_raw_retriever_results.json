The manipulation of the argument inccat/desc/date/amount leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter inccat to be affected. But it must be assumed desc, date, and amount are affected as well.",
