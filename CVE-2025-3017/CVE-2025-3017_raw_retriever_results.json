  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in TA-Lib up to 0.6.4. This issue affects the function setInputBuffer of the file src/tools/ta_regtest/ta_test_func/test_minmax.c of the component ta_regtest. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds write. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 5879180e9070ec35d52948f2f57519713256a0f1. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
