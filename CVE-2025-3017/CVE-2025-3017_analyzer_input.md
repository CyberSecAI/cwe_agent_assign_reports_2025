# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3017

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in TA-Lib up to 0.6.4. This issue affects the function setInputBuffer of the file src/tools/ta_regtest/ta_test_func/test_minmax.c of the component ta_regtest. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds write**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 5879180e9070ec35d52948f2f57519713256a0f1. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **component:** setInputBuffer of the file src/tools/ta_regtest/ta_test_func/test_minmax.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3017 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in TA-Lib. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds (OOB) write condition. Specifically, the `sizeof` operator was incorrectly used when determining the size of `testSerie9` in the `tableRefTest` array within `src/tools/ta_regtest/ta_test_func/test_minmax.c`.  It initially used `sizeof(testSerie10)` instead of `sizeof(testSerie9)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The incorrect size calculation leads to reading beyond the allocated memory buffer for `testSerie9`.
*   **Incorrect array indexing/size calculation:** The core issue stems from a flawed `sizeof` calculation within the array initialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The logs indicate an `AddressSanitizer` error, specifically a `global-buffer-overflow`. While the provided content doesn't detail the full impact, an out-of-bounds write can potentially lead to:

*   **Crash:** The application may crash due to accessing invalid memory.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Reading beyond the buffer could expose sensitive data.
*   **Code Execution:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to overwrite critical data structures and potentially gain control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of the `ta_regtest` tool, specifically within the `test_minmax.c` file.
*   An attacker with the ability to run the `ta_regtest` tool (e.g., a developer or someone with access to the build environment) could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Access to the TA-Lib source code and the ability to build and run the `ta_regtest` tool.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerability and how to trigger it.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the `sizeof` operator in the `tableRefTest` array initialization in `src/tools/ta_regtest/ta_test_func/test_minmax.c`. The incorrect `sizeof(testSerie10)` was changed to `sizeof(testSerie9)`.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `5879180` and merged into the `main` branch by `mario4tier`.
*   Pull Request #62 contains the fix.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific file, line numbers, and the exact code change.
*   The use of AddressSanitizer (ASan) helped identify the vulnerability.
*   The issue was reported by a security researcher (`Lqingyu`).
