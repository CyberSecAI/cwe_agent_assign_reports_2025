The secondary CWE is CWE-787, which is a base-level weakness that results from out-of-bounds writes. These two are related because the **lack of validation** (CWE-1284) can lead to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe787 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe1284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation of the string length** (CWE-1284). This leads to a **heap out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), which results in data integrity issues and allows an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n  - Weakness: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n  - Impact: Data integrity issues, circumvention of secure boot protections\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated keyphrases. The primary **root cause** is the **failure to validate the string length taken as an input**. This directly corresponds to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The subsequent **heap out-of-bounds write** is a consequence of this **lack of validation**, leading to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The relationship graph shows how these two CWEs are connected.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is directly from the vulnerability description: \"When reading a symbolic links name from a UFS filesystem, grub2 **fails to validate the string length taken as an input**. The **lack of validation** may lead to a **heap out-of-bounds write**\".\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1284 directly addresses the **missing validation** aspect, and CWE-787 precisely describes the resulting **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
