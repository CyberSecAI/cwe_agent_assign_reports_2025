This Reflected **XSS** and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 7.1, allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code on a victims browser and force a end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which theyre currently authenticated which has high impact to confidentiality, low impact to integrity, no impact to availability, and requires user interaction. Atlassian recommends that Confluence Data Center and Server customers upgrade to latest version, if you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the specified supported fixed versions * Confluence Data Center and Server 7.19 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 7.19.26 * Confluence Data Center and Server 8.5 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 8.5.14 * Confluence Data Center and Server 9.0 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 9.0.1 See the release notes (https//confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-release-notes-327.html). You can download the latest version of Confluence Data Center and Server from the download center (https//www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives).

The specific location or mechanism of the flaw is not provided, but it is stated to have been introduced in version 4.3.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects attacker-controlled input in the response without proper sanitization, which allows the execution of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the victim's browser.\\n*   **CSRF:**  The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in a victim's browser.\\n*   An attacker can force an authenticated user to execute unwanted actions on the Confluence web application.\\n*   This has a high impact on confidentiality (ability to access sensitive information) and low impact on integrity (potential to modify data or settings), and no impact to availability of the system.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload.\\n*   The attacker uses a CSRF attack to force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on a malicious link (in the case of reflected XSS) or visit a malicious site (in the case of a CSRF attack).\\n*   User interaction is required.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1 and is classified as High severity.\\n*   The vulnerability was discovered through Atlassian's Bug Bounty program.\\n*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.3 of Confluence.\\n\\n**Affected Products/Versions:**\\n\\n*   Confluence Data Center and Server versions:\\n    * 7.19.0 to 7.19.25\\n    * 7.20.0 to 7.20.3\\n    * 8.0.0 to 8.0.4\\n    * 8.1.0 to 8.1.4\\n    * 8.2.0 to 8.2.3\\n    * 8.3.0 to 8.3.4\\n    * 8.4.0 to 8.4.5\\n    * 8.5.0 to 8.5.12\\n    * 8.6.0 to 8.6.2\\n    * 8.7.1 to 8.7.2\\n    * 8.8.0 to 8.8.1\\n    * 8.9.0 to 8.9.4\\n\\n**Fixed Versions:**\\n*   Confluence Data Center and Server 7.19.26\\n*   Confluence Data Center and Server 8.5.14\\n*   Confluence Data Center and Server 8.9.5\\n*   Confluence Data Center

This Reflected **XSS** and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 7.1, allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code on a victims browser and force a end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which theyre currently authenticated which has high impact to confidentiality, low impact to integrity, no impact to availability, and requires user interaction. Atlassian recommends that Confluence Data Center and Server customers upgrade to latest version, if you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the specified supported fixed versions * Confluence Data Center and Server 7.19 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 7.19.26 * Confluence Data Center and Server 8.5 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 8.5.14 * Confluence Data Center and Server 9.0 Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 9.0.1 See the release notes (https//confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-release-notes-327.html).
