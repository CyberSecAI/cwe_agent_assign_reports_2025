## Query
The Redux Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated JSON file uploads due to missing authorization and capability checks on the Redux_Color_Scheme_Import function in versions 4.4.12 to 4.4.17. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload JSON files, which can be used to conduct stored cross-site scripting attacks and, in some rare cases, when the wp_filesystem fails to initialize - to Remote Code Execution.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'missing authorization', 'capability checks'
