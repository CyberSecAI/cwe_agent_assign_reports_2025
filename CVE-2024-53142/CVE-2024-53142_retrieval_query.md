# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-53142

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved initramfs avoid **filename buffer overrun** The initramfs filename field is defined in Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as 37 cpio_file = ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + \\0 + ALGN(4) + data ... 55 ============= ================== ========================= 56 Field name Field size Meaning 57 ============= ================== ========================= ... 70 c_namesize 8 bytes Length of filename, including final \\0 When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernels do_name() path handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod(). If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename and is followed by **uninitialized memory**, then a file may be created with trailing characters that represent the **uninitialized memory**. The ability to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of the system, so the buffer overrun shouldnt be considered a security vulnerability. Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g. ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs Its easiest to observe non-zero **uninitialized memory** when the output is gzipped, as itll **overflow** the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(), rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block. ---- reproducer.sh ---- nilchar=A # change to \\0 to properly zero terminate / pad magic=070701 ino=1 mode=$(( 0100777 )) uid=0 gid=0 nlink=1 mtime=1 filesize=0 devmajor=0 devminor=1 rdevmajor=0 rdevminor=0 csum=0 fname=initramfs_test_fname_overrun namelen=$(( ${#fname} + 1 )) # plus one to account for terminator printf %s%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%s \\ $magic $ino $mode $uid $gid $nlink $mtime $filesize \\ $devmajor $devminor $rdevmajor $rdevminor $namelen $csum $fname termpadlen=$(( 1 + ((4 - ((110 + $namelen) & 3)) % 4) )) printf %.s${nilchar} $(seq 1 $termpadlen) ---- reproducer.sh ---- Symlink filename fields handled in do_symlink() wont overrun past the data segment, due to the explicit zero-termination of the symlink target. Fix **filename buffer overrun** by aborting the initramfs FSM if any cpio entry doesnt carry a zero-terminator at the expected (name_len - 1) offset.
