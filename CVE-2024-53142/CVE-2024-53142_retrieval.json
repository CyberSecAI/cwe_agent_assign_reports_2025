The ability to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of the system, so the buffer overrun shouldnt be considered a security vulnerability.

The `do_name()` path handler in the kernel assumes a zero-terminated path at `@collected`. If a specially crafted cpio entry has a non-null-terminated filename, followed by uninitialized memory, the file may be created with trailing characters that are part of the uninitialized memory.\\n\\n### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\\n- **Missing Null-termination Check:** The kernel's `do_name()` handler does not verify that the filename in the cpio archive is null-terminated.\\n- **Buffer Overrun (potential):** Although the vulnerability isn't considered a security risk, since the attacker already has full control by the time the initramfs is used, a crafted cpio entry without a null terminator in the filename can lead to reading past the intended filename buffer, potentially incorporating uninitialized memory in file creation.\\n\\n### Impact of exploitation:\\n- **File Creation with Unintended Names:** An attacker can create files with names that include uninitialized memory, which could lead to unexpected behavior or directory structures.\\n\\n### Attack vectors:\\n- **Crafted CPIO Archive:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious cpio archive with a non-null-terminated filename. This archive would then be added to the initramfs.\\n- **Gzip Overflow:** The provided reproducer script uses gzip to overflow the heap allocated `@out_buf` in `__gunzip()`, rather than the `initrd_start+initrd_size` block, to observe the non-zero uninitialized memory more easily.\\n\\n### Required attacker capabilities/position:\\n- To exploit this, the attacker needs to be able to modify or create the initramfs image, which typically requires root or administrative privileges on the system before it boots. The vulnerability can only be exploited during the early boot process when the initramfs is being parsed.\\n\\n### Additional notes:\\n- The provided patches fix the vulnerability by adding an explicit null-termination check before passing the path to `filp_open()`, `init_mkdir()`, or `init_mknod()`. This check verifies if a cpio entry carries a zero-terminator at the expected (name\\\\_len - 1) offset, and will cause the initramfs FSM to abort if the check fails. This prevents creation of files with unexpected names.\\n- The vulnerability is not considered a security issue because the attacker needs to control the initramfs, which means that the system is already fully compromised.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename and is followed by **uninitialized memory**, then a file may be created with trailing characters that represent the **uninitialized memory**. The ability to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of the system, so the buffer overrun shouldnt be considered a security vulnerability. Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g. ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs Its easiest to observe non-zero **uninitialized memory** when the output is gzipped, as itll **overflow** the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(), rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block. ---- reproducer.sh ---- nilchar=A # change to \\\\0 to properly zero terminate / pad magic=070701 ino=1 mode=$(( 0100777 )) uid=0 gid=0 nlink=1 mtime=1 filesize=0 devmajor=0 devminor=1 rdevmajor=0 rdevminor=0 csum=0 fname=initramfs_test_fname_overrun namelen=$(( ${#fname} + 1 )) # plus one to account for terminator printf %s%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%s \\\\ $magic $ino $mode $uid $gid $nlink $mtime $filesize \\\\ $devmajor $devminor $rdevmajor $rdevminor $namelen $csum $fname termpadlen=$(( 1 + ((4 - ((110 + $namelen) & 3)) % 4) )) printf %.s${nilchar} $(seq 1 $termpadlen) ---- reproducer.sh ---- Symlink filename fields handled in do_symlink() wont overrun past the data segment, due to the explicit zero-termination of the symlink target. Fix **filename buffer overrun** by aborting the initramfs FSM if any cpio entry doesnt carry a zero-terminator at the expected (name_len - 1) offset.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'uninitialized memory'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
