  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved initramfs avoid **filename buffer overrun** The initramfs filename field is defined in Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as 37 cpio_file = ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + \\\\0 + ALGN(4) + data ... 55 ============= ================== ========================= 56 Field name Field size Meaning 57 ============= ================== ========================= ... 70 c_namesize 8 bytes Length of filename, including final \\\\0 When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernels do_name() path handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod(). If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename and is followed by **uninitialized memory**, then a file may be created with trailing characters that represent the **uninitialized memory**. The ability to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of the system, so the buffer overrun shouldnt be considered a security vulnerability. Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g. ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs Its easiest to observe non-zero **uninitialized memory** when the output is gzipped, as itll **overflow** the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(), rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block. ---- reproducer.sh ---- nilchar=A # change to \\\\0 to properly zero terminate / pad magic=070701 ino=1 mode=$(( 0100777 )) uid=0 gid=0 nlink=1 mtime=1 filesize=0 devmajor=0 devminor=1 rdevmajor=0 rdevminor=0 csum=0 fname=initramfs_test_fname_overrun namelen=$(( ${#fname} + 1 )) # plus one to account for terminator printf %s%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%s \\\\ $magic $ino $mode $uid $gid $nlink $mtime $filesize \\\\ $devmajor $devminor $rdevmajor $rdevminor $namelen $csum $fname termpadlen=$(( 1 + ((4 - ((110 + $namelen) & 3)) % 4) )) printf %.s${nilchar} $(seq 1 $termpadlen) ---- reproducer.sh ---- Symlink filename fields handled in do_symlink() wont overrun past the data segment, due to the explicit zero-termination of the symlink target.

  "reference_content": "### Root cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability is caused by a missing null-termination check when extracting filenames from a cpio archive within the initramfs. The `do_name()` path handler in the kernel assumes a zero-terminated path at `@collected`. If a specially crafted cpio entry has a non-null-terminated filename, followed by uninitialized memory, the file may be created with trailing characters that are part of the uninitialized memory.\n\n### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- **Missing Null-termination Check:** The kernel's `do_name()` handler does not verify that the filename in the cpio archive is null-terminated.\n- **Buffer Overrun (potential):** Although the vulnerability isn't considered a security risk, since the attacker already has full control by the time the initramfs is used, a crafted cpio entry without a null terminator in the filename can lead to reading past the intended filename buffer, potentially incorporating uninitialized memory in file creation.\n\n### Impact of exploitation:\n- **File Creation with Unintended Names:** An attacker can create files with names that include uninitialized memory, which could lead to unexpected behavior or directory structures.\n\n### Attack vectors:\n- **Crafted CPIO Archive:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious cpio archive with a non-null-terminated filename. This archive would then be added to the initramfs.\n- **Gzip Overflow:** The provided reproducer script uses gzip to overflow the heap allocated `@out_buf` in `__gunzip()`, rather than the `initrd_start+initrd_size` block, to observe the non-zero uninitialized memory more easily.\n\n### Required attacker capabilities/position:\n- To exploit this, the attacker needs to be able to modify or create the initramfs image, which typically requires root or administrative privileges on the system before it boots. The vulnerability can only be exploited during the early boot process when the initramfs is being parsed.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The provided patches fix the vulnerability by adding an explicit null-termination check before passing the path to `filp_open()`, `init_mkdir()`, or `init_mknod()`. This check verifies if a cpio entry carries a zero-terminator at the expected (name\\_len - 1) offset, and will cause the initramfs FSM to abort if the check fails. This prevents creation of files with unexpected names.\n- The vulnerability is not considered a security issue because the attacker needs to control the initramfs, which means that the system is already fully compromised.",

If the string is not properly null-terminated, it can lead to out-of-bounds reads (CWE-126). The **uninitialized memory** could point to CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource if the memory being read past the buffer is **uninitialized**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe170[\"CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe909 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe170 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe126\n    cwe170 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe909\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe170 primary\n    class cwe126,cwe909 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper null termination** (CWE-170) of the filename in the cpio archive. This leads to reading beyond the intended buffer (CWE-126), potentially exposing **uninitialized memory** (CWE-909) and resulting in the creation of a file with unexpected trailing characters. The **filename buffer overrun** is a direct consequence of the missing null terminator.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper null termination** (CWE-170) of the filename within the initramfs cpio archive. The description explicitly mentions that the kernel's path handler assumes a zero-terminated path, and a specially crafted cpio entry with a non-zero-terminated filename can lead to the issue. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-170.\n\nThe **buffer overrun** is a symptom, and **uninitialized memory** is an additional factor. An over-read (CWE-126) from the missing null terminator reads **uninitialized memory** (CWE-909).\n\nThe retriever results and keyphrase analysis both support this conclusion, with CWE-170 being a relevant candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource) are also relevant, they are consequences of the primary weakness (CWE-170).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-170 is a Base CWE, representing the core issue. CWE-126 and CWE-909 are secondary contributing factors. The relationships between these CWEs are well-defined, with CWE-170 potentially leading to CWE-126, and the **uninitialized memory** triggering CWE-909.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
