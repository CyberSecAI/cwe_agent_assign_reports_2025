# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-13916
## Query
An application com.pri.applock, which is pre-loaded on Kruger&Matz smartphones, allows a user to encrypt any application using user-provided PIN code or by using biometric data. Exposed com.android.providers.settings.fingerprint.PriFpShareProvider content providers public method query() allows any other malicious application, without any granted Android system permissions, to exfiltrate the PIN code. Only version (version name 13, version code 33) was tested and confirmed to have this vulnerability. Application update was released in April 2025.
