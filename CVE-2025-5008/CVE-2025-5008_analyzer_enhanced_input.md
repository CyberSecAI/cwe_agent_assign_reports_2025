## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5008 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability. The CVE description is missing, but the content provides detailed information about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter in the `/admin/add_teacher.php` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'e' parameter in a POST request to `/admin/add_teacher.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product:** Online Time Table Generator PHP MYSQL V1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/add_teacher.php`
*   **Payload Example:** A time-based blind SQL injection payload is provided.
*   **Proof of Concept:** Includes a `sqlmap` command and screenshot demonstrating exploitation.
