# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11010

## Vulnerability Description
The FileOrganizer Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Local JavaScript File Inclusion** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 via the default_lang parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server, allowing the execution of any JavaScript code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** bypass access controls and obtain sensitive data and achieve code execution
- **vector:** default_lang parameter
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Administrator-level access and above
- **product:** FileOrganizer Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.1.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `default_lang` parameter in the FileOrganizer plugin. This parameter is used to load language files dynamically for the elFinder file manager. The plugin was using the value of `default_lang` directly in the file path for the language file, without sanitizing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local JavaScript File Inclusion:** The core vulnerability is a local JavaScript file inclusion, where a user-controlled value is used to build a path to a JavaScript file, which is then loaded and executed within the application's context.
- **Path Traversal:**  By manipulating the `default_lang` parameter, an attacker could include JavaScript files from outside the intended plugin directory. This is due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `default_lang` parameter, allowing for potentially malicious file paths to be constructed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server by including and running a crafted JavaScript file.
- **Bypass Access Controls:**  The execution of arbitrary Javascript could be used to bypass access controls.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  JavaScript code executed in this manner can be used to access sensitive data.
- **Code Execution:** By uploading and including a malicious file the attacker can achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the `default_lang` parameter, which is part of the plugin's settings.
- This parameter is used when registering the `forg-lang` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator Access:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level access or above to modify the plugin's settings including the `default_lang` option.
