# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42453

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability Veeam Backup & Replication allows low-privileged users to control and modify configurations on connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This includes the ability to power off virtual machines, delete files in storage, and make configuration changes, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) and data integrity issues. The vulnerability is caused by **improper permission checks** in methods accessed via management services.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper permission checks**
- **impact:** power off virtual machines, delete files in storage, make configuration changes, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) and data integrity issues
- **attacker:** low-privileged users
- **product:** Veeam Backup & Replication

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-42453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the Veeam Backup & Replication software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authenticated users with specific roles (assigned via "Users and Roles settings") on the backup server are able to modify the configuration of connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This indicates an improper authorization mechanism that allows users with limited roles to perform actions that should require higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with the necessary role can control and modify the configuration of the connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This could include changes to critical settings that could disrupt operations, introduce vulnerabilities, or allow further unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and requires a user to be authenticated to the Veeam Backup & Replication server with specific permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with a role assigned in the "Users and Roles settings" on the Veeam Backup & Replication server, which grants the necessary level of access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is classified as "High" severity with a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- The vulnerability affects Veeam Backup & Replication version 12.2.0.334 and all earlier builds of version 12.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
- Mitigation involves removing untrusted or unnecessary users from the "Users and Roles settings" until the server is upgraded to version 12.3.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
