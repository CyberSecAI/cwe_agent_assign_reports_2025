# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37909
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net lan743x Fix memleak issue when GSO enabled Always map the `skb` to the LS descriptor. Previously skb was mapped to EXT descriptor when the number of fragments is zero with GSO enabled. Mapping the skb to EXT descriptor prevents it from being freed, leading to a memory leak

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'memory leak'
