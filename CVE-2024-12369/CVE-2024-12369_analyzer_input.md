# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12369

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in OIDC-Client. When using the RH SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x or when using the elytron-oidc-client subsystem with EAP 8.x, **authorization code injection** attacks can occur, allowing an attacker to inject a stolen authorization code into the attackers own session with the client with a victims identity. This is usually done with a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or phishing attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authorization code injection**
- **impact:** inject a stolen authorization code into the attackers own session with the client with a victims identity and phishing attack
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** WildFly
- **version:** 7.x and 8.x

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way the `elytron-oidc-client` handles authorization codes during the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication process. Specifically, the client does not adequately verify or protect against the substitution of authorization codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Code Injection:** An attacker can inject a stolen authorization code into their own authentication flow.
- **Lack of Sufficient Validation:** The client does not properly validate the origin or legitimacy of the authorization code, allowing it to be swapped with a stolen one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Identity Spoofing:** An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session by injecting their stolen authorization code, effectively assuming the victim's identity within the application.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can gain access to the application with the victim's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the authorization code during a legitimate user's authentication flow.
- **Phishing:** An attacker could trick a user into providing their authorization code through a phishing attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Acquisition:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid authorization code from a legitimate user's authentication process.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or modify the request/response flow during authentication.
- **Active Session:** The attacker needs to initiate the login flow to inject the code during authentication.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the authentication flow and the vulnerability itself to inject the code properly.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x and `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem with EAP 8.x.
- The attacker replaces a newly generated authorization code with the stolen one during the authorization exchange.
- The OIDC provider performs its checks successfully and issue tokens associated with the victim to the attacker.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
