  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in vLLM AIBrix 0.2.0 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file pkg/plugins/gateway/prefixcacheindexer/hash.go of the component Prefix Caching. The manipulation leads to insufficiently random values. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. Upgrading to version 0.3.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
