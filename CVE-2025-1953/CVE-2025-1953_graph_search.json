Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file pkg/plugins/gateway/prefixcacheindexer/hash.go of the component Prefix Caching. The manipulation leads to insufficiently random values. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. Upgrading to version 0.3.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-334 CWE-121 CWE-79 CWE-704 CWE-89 CWE-927 CWE-1204 CWE-22",
