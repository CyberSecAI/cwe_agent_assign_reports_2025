## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-0704 as it describes a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `qrCode` method in `src/main/java/io/github/controller/QrCodeController.java` does not restrict the `w` and `h` parameters (width and height) used for QR code generation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Lack of input validation on the `w` and `h` parameters in the `qrCode` method.

**Impact of exploitation:**
This lack of restriction can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can send requests to the `qrCode` method with excessively large values for `w` and `h`, potentially consuming significant server resources during QR code generation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`qrCode` method). No authentication is mentioned as being required.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The issue description implies that input validation and/or limiting the maximum allowed values for `w` and `h` in the `qrCode` method would resolve the vulnerability.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically pinpointing the vulnerable code location and the parameters involved.
