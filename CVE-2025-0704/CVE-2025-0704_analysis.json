  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d. Affected is the function qrCode of the file src/main/java/io/github/controller/QrCodeController.java. The manipulation of the argument w/h leads to resource consumption. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-0704 as it describes a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `qrCode` method in `src/main/java/io/github/controller/QrCodeController.java` does not restrict the `w` and `h` parameters (width and height) used for QR code generation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nLack of input validation on the `w` and `h` parameters in the `qrCode` method.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThis lack of restriction can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nAn attacker can send requests to the `qrCode` method with excessively large values for `w` and `h`, potentially consuming significant server resources during QR code generation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`qrCode` method). No authentication is mentioned as being required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe issue description implies that input validation and/or limiting the maximum allowed values for `w` and `h` in the `qrCode` method would resolve the vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically pinpointing the vulnerable code location and the parameters involved.",

This CWE is at the Base level, which is preferred. A potential consequence of CWE-1284 is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), as **improper** validation can lead to excessive resource usage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper** input validation (CWE-1284), specifically the `w` and `h` parameters used for QR code generation. This **lack of validation** leads to the ability to provide excessively large values, ultimately resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which clearly indicates a **lack of input validation** on the `w` and `h` parameters and the resulting resource consumption.\n\nThe core of the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `qrCode` method does not restrict the `w` and `h` parameters. This **lack of validation** allows an attacker to provide excessively large values, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption. The selection of CWE-1284 as the primary CWE directly reflects this **improper validation** of the specified quantity (width and height).\n\nCWE-400 is a potential consequence, as the **lack of validation** on input can lead to excessive resource usage.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the CVE reference summary specifically mentions the **lack of input validation** and the ability to cause a Denial of Service attack.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
