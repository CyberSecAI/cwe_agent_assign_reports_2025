User can use this credential to request other users information, including the administrators username, password, salt value, etc. Mitigation all users should upgrade to 2.1.4",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29120:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is that after a successful login, the Apache StreamPark backend service returns the \"Authorization\" header as the authentication credential to the frontend. This credential is not scoped to the logged-in user and can be used to access other users' information.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage. The exposed \"Authorization\" credential allows an authenticated user to potentially access sensitive data of other users.\n- **Insecure Credential Handling:** The application improperly handles authentication credentials by exposing them in the response and not associating them uniquely to the logged-in user session.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use the leaked credential to access information of other users.\n- **Credential Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, such as the administrator's username, password, and salt value, by making requests with the leaked credential.\n- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By compromising an administrator account through credential theft, an attacker could gain full control over the StreamPark application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the application's HTTP API. A successfully logged-in user can capture the \"Authorization\" header, and then reuse it to make unauthorized API requests.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Apache StreamPark application and successfully authenticate at least once to obtain the leaky Authorization header.\n- No special privileges or system access is required beyond being a valid user.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description. It specifies that the leaked information includes username, password, and salt values, which is quite sensitive.\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 2.1.4.\n- The vulnerability has a **\"Severity: important\"** tag.",

CWE-201 is a peer and was considered as a secondary issue for inserting the credentials. The selection was guided by the principle of identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, focusing on the authorization bypass through user-controlled keys.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication** where the \"Authorization\" header is returned as the authentication credential. This leads to **authorization bypass** as the user can use this credential to request other users' information (CWE-639). Finally, the sensitive information is disclosed (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to authentication and authorization. However, the key aspect of this vulnerability is that the existing authentication mechanism, while present, **incorrectly** authorizes the user. The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data by using the same key value, which fits CWE-639 perfectly. The **rootcause** is that after a successful login, the Apache StreamPark backend service returns the \"Authorization\" header as the authentication credential to the frontend. This credential is not scoped to the logged-in user and can be used to access other users' information. The evidence is from \"**CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\". The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also calls out \"**improper authentication**\".\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence and the guidance on authentication vs. authorization.
