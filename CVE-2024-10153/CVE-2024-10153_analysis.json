  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file book-boat.php?bid=1 of the component Book a Boat Page. The manipulation of the argument nopeople leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The `nopeople` parameter in the `book-boat.php` page of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`nopeople` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify, delete, or extract sensitive data from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL commands.\n*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive information such as user credentials, booking details, or financial data could be exposed.\n*   **Application Compromise:**  In severe cases, the application and server itself could be compromised, potentially allowing for further malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request targeting the `book-boat.php` page and manipulates the `nopeople` parameter to include malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `book-boat.php` page. This implies that the attacker must have network access to the application, which can be either local or remote, depending on how the application is deployed.\n*   The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to construct a malicious payload that targets the underlying database.\n\n**Additional Details from VulDB:**\n*   The vulnerability was submitted by user `jadu101`.\n*   The submission was on 10/17/2024 and moderated on 10/18/2024.\n*   VulDB ID is 280939.\n*   The vulnerable page is `book-boat.php?bid=1`.\n\nThe GitHub content references a file that provides more details on the vulnerability: `phpgurukul_boat_booking_system_book_boat_sqli.md`\n\nThis is a classic SQL injection vulnerability, and it\u2019s critical to fix it to avoid unauthorized access and manipulation of the database.",
