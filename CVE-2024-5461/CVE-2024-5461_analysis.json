It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) on the Brocade 6547 (FC5022) embedded switch blade. The SNMP implementation makes internal script calls to `system.sh` from within the SNMP binary.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* **CWE-77:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command. This allows for command or parameter injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn authenticated attacker could perform command or parameter injection on SNMP operations. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to issue commands as Root.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* Exploitation occurs via unique embedded switch SNMP commands.\n* Requires SNMP user account access.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* Authenticated attacker with SNMP user account access.\n* Ability to issue unique embedded switch SNMP commands.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* A solution is provided in Fabric OS 8.2.3e1\\_pha patch release, which removes the vulnerable component from the code.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n* **Affected Products:** Brocade 6547 (FC5022) embedded switches running Brocade Fabric OS prior to 8.2.3e1\\_pha firmware.\n* **Products Not Affected:** All Brocade switches other than the Brocade 6547 running Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to 9.0, and all Brocade switches running Brocade Fabric OS v9.0 and later.\n* **CVSS Score:** 8.6 CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n* **Credit:** Pierre Barre reported the issue to Brocade.\n* **Advisory ID:** BSA-2024-2597",

CWE-77 is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability involves **command injection** in the context of OS commands, making CWE-78 a more specific and appropriate choice. The Retriever results also list CWE-78 as a strong candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of special elements in OS commands, leading to **command injection**, and finally resulting in the ability to execute commands as Root.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n  - **Impact:** Execution of commands as Root.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary both point to **command injection** due to **improper neutralization** of special elements. The Retriever results list both CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates. Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is the more appropriate and specific choice.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-78 is strong, as the CVE reference summary explicitly mentions \"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command. This allows for command or parameter injection.\" and states that the attacker can \"issue commands as Root.\" Although the CVE summary mentions CWE-77, selecting CWE-78 is more precise since the injection occurs specifically in OS commands.\n\nCWE-77 was considered but not used as the primary CWE because CWE-78 is a more specific Base level CWE that better describes the vulnerability which involves OS commands. Other CWEs like CWE-20, CWE-89, and CWE-94 were considered but deemed less relevant as they focus on general input validation or specific injection types (e.g., SQL injection) that are not applicable in this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
