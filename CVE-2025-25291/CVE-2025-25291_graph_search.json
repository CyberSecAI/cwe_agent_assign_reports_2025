An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently the parsers can generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may lead to authentication bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 fix the issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1390 CWE-611 CWE-112 CWE-347 CWE-328 CWE-918 CWE-1333 CWE-289",
