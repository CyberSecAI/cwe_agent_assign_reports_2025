## Vulnerability Description
A **Denial of Service** (DoS) vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.66.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause excessive resource consumption by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries. This flaw in the multipart request boundary processing mechanism leads to an **infinite loop**, resulting in a complete denial of service for all users. Affected endpoints include `/api/v1/login` and `/api/v1/device_authorization`.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** zenml-io/zenml
- **version:** 0.66.0
- **component:** multipart request boundary processing mechanism

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-9340 Content

The provided content relates to a fix for preventing excessively large requests to the ZenML server. It addresses potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities by limiting the request body size and restricting file uploads to specific endpoints.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The ZenML server was susceptible to denial-of-service attacks due to the acceptance of arbitrarily large requests and unrestricted file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** Accepting large request bodies could exhaust server resources (memory, processing power), leading to a denial of service.
*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Allowing file uploads to any endpoint could be exploited to upload malicious files or consume excessive storage space.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could send a large request, causing the server to become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Excessive resource consumption could impact the availability of the ZenML server for legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker could send a crafted HTTP request with a large body size over the network.
*   **HTTP POST requests:** An attacker could send a POST request with a large file attached.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ZenML server.
*   **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Request Body Size Limit:** Implemented a `RequestBodyLimit` middleware to limit the maximum size of the request body to a configurable value (defaulting to 256KB).
*   **File Upload Restriction:** Implemented a `RestrictFileUploadsMiddleware` to restrict file uploads to specific allowed paths.
*   **Configuration:** Added `max_request_body_size_in_bytes` to the `ServerConfiguration` class to allow administrators to configure the maximum request body size.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, middleware implementations, and configuration options related to the fix. It also explains the reasoning behind the changes and the potential impact of the vulnerabilities.
