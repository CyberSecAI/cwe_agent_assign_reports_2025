## Vulnerability Description
An arbitrary memory write vulnerability was discovered in Supermicro X11DPH-T, X11DPH-Tq, and X11DPH-i motherboards with BIOS firmware before 4.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** arbitrary memory write
- **product:** ['Supermicro X11DPH-T' and 'X11DPH-Tq' and 'X11DPH-i motherboards']
- **version:** before 4.4
- **component:** BIOS firmware

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-36433:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   Improper input validation in the Supermicro BIOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   Arbitrary memory write: The vulnerability allows an attacker to write to arbitrary memory locations due to a lack of proper input validation in the BIOS firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Potential for arbitrary code execution. By writing to arbitrary memory, an attacker could potentially hijack the control flow of the system and execute malicious code.
-   Escalation of privileges: Attackers with kernel-level privileges could escalate their privileges further.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is present in the BIOS firmware.
-   Exploitation likely requires some level of access to the system, such as kernel-level privileges, or the ability to modify the BIOS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system in order to exploit this vulnerability. This could potentially include kernel-level access, or the ability to modify the BIOS.
-   The attacker would need to craft inputs that trigger the arbitrary memory write condition by exploiting the lack of proper input validation in the BIOS.

**Affected Products:**

-   X11DPH-T
-   X11DPH-Tq
-    X11DPH-i

**Mitigation:**
-   Upgrade the BIOS to version 4.4 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability was reported by external researchers.
-  Supermicro is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is High (7.5).
