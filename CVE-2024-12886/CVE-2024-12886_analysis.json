  "description": "An **Out-Of-Memory (OOM) vulnerability** exists in the `ollama` server version 0.3.14. This vulnerability can be triggered when a malicious API server responds with a gzip bomb HTTP response, leading to the `ollama` server crashing. The vulnerability is present in the `makeRequestWithRetry` and `getAuthorizationToken` functions, which use `io.ReadAll` to read the response body. This can result in excessive memory usage and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.",

The server allocates memory without proper limits, leading to a denial-of-service condition. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability leads to uncontrolled consumption of resources, specifically memory. |\n| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Memory allocation is based on an excessively large size value received from a malicious source. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770, which describes allocating resources without limits. CWE-400 is a broader class that encompasses uncontrolled resource consumption, while CWE-789 is a variant focusing on memory allocation with excessive size. The relationships show that CWE-770 is a specific type of CWE-400 and can lead to CWE-789 if the unthrottled resource is memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)**. A malicious server sends a gzip bomb which leads to **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)**, which results in **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**, specifically memory exhaustion, ultimately causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **Out-Of-Memory (OOM) vulnerability** caused by a gzip bomb. The `io.ReadAll` function reads the response body without proper size validation, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770 because the root cause is the lack of limits on resource allocation, specifically memory. This leads to excessive memory allocation based on the gzip bomb (CWE-789), ultimately resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and denial of service.\n\nThe relationships between CWEs helped refine the selection. CWE-770 is more specific than CWE-400, providing a better representation of the root cause. While CWE-789 is relevant, it describes the specific scenario (excessive size value) rather than the underlying weakness (lack of limits).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description directly supports this classification: \"This can result in excessive memory usage and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\" This highlights the uncontrolled resource consumption aspect. The fact that a \"gzip bomb HTTP response\" triggers the issue points to the lack of limits and proper validation of the response size.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of limits** on resource allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context
