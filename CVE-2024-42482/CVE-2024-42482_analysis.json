  "description": "fish-shop/syntax-check is a GitHub action for syntax checking fish shell files. Improper neutralization of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary **command injection** is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity. It is recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42482:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper handling of delimiters in the `pattern` input of the `fish-shop/syntax-check` GitHub Action. Specifically, command separators (`;`) and command substitution characters (`(` and `)`) are not neutralized, leading to potential command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **CWE-140: Improper Neutralization of Delimiters:** The action fails to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input (`pattern`) before using it in a command execution context. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `pattern` input.\n- **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the workflow runner, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the workflow runner.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure/Exfiltration:** Attackers can access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information like environment variables, API keys, or other secrets stored in the workflow runner environment.\n- **Compromise of the Build Environment:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the build process or install malicious software on the runner.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- An attacker can inject malicious commands into the `pattern` input of the GitHub Action. This input is used within an `eval` statement in the action's shell script.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `pattern` input of the `fish-shop/syntax-check` GitHub Action. This could be achieved through:\n    - Submitting a pull request that modifies the workflow definition, and injects malicious code into the pattern input.\n    - Exploiting a vulnerability in a related system to modify workflow files that make use of the vulnerable action.\n    - Being an internal actor with push rights to the repository who can directly modify the workflow files.\n\nThe provided information includes:\n- **Vulnerability description:** Describes the root cause and impact of the improper neutralization of delimiters\n- **Affected versions:** Lists the vulnerable versions.\n- **Patched versions:** Identifies the versions that include a fix for the vulnerability\n- **Workaround:** Suggests updating to patched versions and to be cautious of the input value.\n- **References:** Links to relevant CWE and CAPEC entries, providing further context on the vulnerability.\n- **Patch summary:** Details the commits that introduced the fix, and their associated versions.\n- **Severity:** Labels the severity of the issue as \"Moderate\"\n\nThis content provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description.",

CWE-77 is a Class, while CWE-78 is a more specific Base. The vulnerability allows for command injection due to improper neutralization, which aligns with CWE-77. CWE-140 represents the underlying cause of the vulnerability.

This leads to the ability to inject commands (CWE-77), ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution and potential exfiltration of sensitive information. The root cause is CWE-140, while the resulting vulnerability is CWE-77.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **command injection** vulnerability due to **improper input sanitization**. The retriever results suggested CWE-77 as the primary candidate, which aligns well with the vulnerability description.

When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n",
