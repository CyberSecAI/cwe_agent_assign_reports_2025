# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-1716

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-1716
## Query
picklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat pip as an unsafe global. An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not a restricted global, the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'picklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat pip as an unsafe global'
- **weakness**: 'pip is not a restricted global'
