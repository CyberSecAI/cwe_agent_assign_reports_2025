## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Siemens SINEC Security Monitor (All versions < V4.9.0). The affected application does not properly neutralize special elements in user input to the ```ssmctl-client``` command. This could allow an authenticated, lowly privileged local attacker to execute privileged commands in the underlying OS.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **impact:** execute privileged commands
- **attacker:** authenticated lowly privileged local attacker
- **product:** Siemens SINEC Security Monitor
- **version:** All versions less than V4.9.0
- **component:** ssmctl-client command

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly neutralize special elements in user input to the `ssmctl-client` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command injection (CWE-77). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input to the `ssmctl-client` command, which allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated, lowly privileged local attacker can execute privileged commands on the underlying OS. This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access to the affected system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the local system running the vulnerable application.
