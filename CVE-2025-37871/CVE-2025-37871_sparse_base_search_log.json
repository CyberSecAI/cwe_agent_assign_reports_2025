Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock in generic_delete_lease. This means 1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0 2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to acquire cl_lock 3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created. Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings.",
