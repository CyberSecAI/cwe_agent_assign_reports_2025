CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, while there might be more specific Base-level children. However, the provided information does not give enough details to pinpoint the exact authorization flaw, so the class level is appropriate. CWE-200, representing information disclosure, is a potential impact of the **improper authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization** (CWE-285), which allows a low-privileged user to bypass the external content warning. This bypass leads to information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an **improper authorization** (CWE-285) issue, where a low-privileged user can bypass the external content warning modal dialog box. This leads to information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\nThe evidence supporting this is: \"a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could **bypass** the external content warning modal dialog box in Dashboard Studio dashboards which could lead to an information disclosure.\"\n\nCWE-285 is chosen as the primary weakness because the **bypass** represents a failure in the authorization mechanism. The advisory explicitly states \"A low-privileged user can **bypass** the external content warning modal dialog box in Dashboard Studio dashboards.\"\n\nCWE-200 is a secondary weakness because it represents the technical impact of the **improper authorization**. The bypass allows access to sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results listed several CWEs.\n*   CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, was suggested in the CVE reference content summary, but **improper authorization** more accurately describes the root cause.\n*   CWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, was considered but deemed less accurate than CWE-285 because the core issue is not about incorrect assignment of permissions, but the **bypass** of an authorization check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
