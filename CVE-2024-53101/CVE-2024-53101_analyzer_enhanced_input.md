# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs Fix **uninitialized value issue** in from_kuid and from_kgid ocfs2_setattr() uses attr->ia_mode, attr->ia_uid and attr->ia_gid in a trace point even though ATTR_MODE, ATTR_UID and ATTR_GID arent set. Initialize all fields of newattrs to avoid **uninitialized variables**, by checking if ATTR_MODE, ATTR_UID, ATTR_GID are initialized, otherwise 0.
