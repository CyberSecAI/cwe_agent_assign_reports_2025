While CWE-425 is more specific, the evidence supporting direct request is limited. Therefore, CWE-285 is chosen due to the explicit mention of \"**improper access controls**\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access controls** in the `addInterceptors` function of `MvcConfig.java`, leading to potential unauthorized access to resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper access controls**,\" which aligns with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While more specific CWEs exist, like CWE-425, the description doesn't provide enough detail to confidently select them. Therefore, CWE-285 is the most appropriate choice based on the available evidence.\n\nThe graph relationships support this decision, as CWE-285 is a parent to more specific authorization-related CWEs. The selection of CWE-285 is at a suitable level of specificity, given the limited information provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.318\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe software performs authorization for a security-critical task, but does not correctly perform the authorization.\n\n## CWE Details\n\n### CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) occurs when software does not correctly perform authorization checks for security-critical tasks. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. In this case, the `addInterceptors` function in `MvcConfig.java` seems to have **improper access controls**, which could allow attackers to bypass intended authorization mechanisms.\n\n**Security Implications:**\nThe security implications of CWE-285 include unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or execution of privileged operations.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:**\nCWE-285 is a class-level CWE, with potential child CWEs like CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) representing more specific scenarios.\n\n**Mapping Guidance Analysis:**\nCWE-285 is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\n### CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) occurs when a web application does not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. An attacker can directly request these resources by guessing or manipulating their URLs, bypassing intended access controls.\n\n**Security Implications:**\nThe security implications of CWE-425 include unauthorized access to sensitive information, execution of privileged functions, and potential compromise of the entire application.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:**\nCWE-425 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), representing a specific type of authorization bypass.\n\n**Mapping Guidance Analysis:**\nCWE-425 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping.\n\n## Candidates Considered and Rejected\n\n*   CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-1336: These CWEs relate to injection vulnerabilities, which are not the primary issue described in the vulnerability description. The description focuses on authorization, not input handling.\n*   CWE-94: This CWE relates to code injection, which is not directly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-266: This CWE relates to incorrect privilege assignment. This is close, but the description is closer to authorization than privilege assignment.\n*   CWE-73: This CWE relates to external control of file name or path. It is not related to the vulnerability description.",
