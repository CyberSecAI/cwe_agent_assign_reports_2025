# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39485

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media v4l async Properly re-initialise notifier entry in unregister **The notifier_entry of a notifier is not re-initialised after unregistering the notifier**. This leads to dangling pointers being left there so use list_del_init() to return the notifier_entry an empty list.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **The notifier_entry of a notifier is not re-initialised after unregistering the notifier**
- **impact:** dangling pointers
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** media v4l async

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `v4l2-async.c` driver within the Linux kernel. When a v4l2 async notifier is unregistered, the `notifier_entry` is not properly re-initialized, leading to a dangling pointer. Specifically, `list_del()` was used instead of `list_del_init()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Dangling Pointer:** The primary vulnerability is a dangling pointer resulting from improper unregistration of a notifier. The `notifier_entry` within the `v4l2_async_notifier` struct is removed from the list using `list_del()`, but the entry itself is not re-initialized.
- **Use-After-Free Potential:**  A dangling pointer can potentially lead to a use-after-free condition if the memory it points to is subsequently freed or reused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined behavior:** Exploitation could lead to undefined behavior, which could result in a system crash or, under certain circumstances, potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a V4L2 async notifier is unregistered.
-  A local attacker might trigger this vulnerability by manipulating the v4l2 subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the V4L2 subsystem and trigger the unregistration of a notifier. This typically requires some level of access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves replacing `list_del(&notifier->notifier_entry);` with `list_del_init(&notifier->notifier_entry);`. The `list_del_init()` function, in addition to removing the entry from the list, also re-initializes the list entry, preventing the dangling pointer.
- The fix was introduced in commit `9537a8425a7a0222999d5839a0b394b1e8834b4a` and is included in the stable kernel versions 6.6 and later.

This analysis provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific function calls causing the issue and the fix implemented.
