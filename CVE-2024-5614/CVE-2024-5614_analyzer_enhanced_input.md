## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5614

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `pafe_posts_list` function within the Piotnet Addons For Elementor plugin. This function is accessible to unauthenticated users through WordPress's AJAX functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The `pafe_posts_list` function is hooked to both `wp_ajax_pafe_posts_list` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_pafe_posts_list` actions, making it accessible to both logged-in and unauthenticated users.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The function retrieves and exposes post data without proper access control, including titles and excerpts.
- **Lack of Status Filtering:**  The function doesn't filter by post status, inadvertently disclosing draft, future, and pending posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve titles and excerpts of posts that are not yet publicly accessible, including drafts, future scheduled posts, and pending review posts.
- **Potential for Information Gathering:** This exposure could reveal pre-release content, internal communications, or other sensitive information that was not intended for public consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a direct AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_pafe_posts_list` or `wp_ajax_nopriv_pafe_posts_list` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in versions of the plugin up to and including 2.4.29.
- It was patched in version 2.4.30.
- The fix primarily involves restricting the query to only include posts with a 'publish' status as seen in the code diff of `inc/ajax-posts-list.php`.
```diff
- $args['posts_per_page'] = $posts_per_page;
+ $args['posts_per_page'] = $posts_per_page;
+ $args['post_status'] = 'publish';
```
- The change log in `readme.txt` describes the update as "* Fix get posts list".
- The Wordfence Intelligence description notes that this allows "unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including titles and excerpts of future, draft, and pending blog posts."
