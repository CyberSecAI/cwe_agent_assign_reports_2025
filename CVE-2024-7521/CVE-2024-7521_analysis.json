Matches the **weakness** in the description. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary identified CWE is CWE-416 (Use After Free). This is a Variant level CWE, making it a specific classification. While many other CWEs are related to memory management and concurrency (e.g., CWE-787, CWE-125, CWE-362), CWE-416 is the most direct and specific match for the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions a use-after-free condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incomplete WebAssembly exception handling** which leads to a **use-after-free** condition. The root cause is the incomplete exception handling, which results in the use-after-free vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **use-after-free** condition. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is \"Incomplete WebAssembly exception handling\" leading to a \"Potential use-after-free vulnerability\".\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-416 as the top combined result. The abstraction level is Variant, and the usage is Allowed, making it an appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the final selection is CWE-416 (Use After Free). This CWE accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability and is supported by the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.
