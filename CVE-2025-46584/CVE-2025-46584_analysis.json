CWE-303 does not have any parent or child relationship with other CWEs except for peer relationships. CWE-287 is a Class level CWE, which is too high level. The relationships between the CWEs guided the selection of the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe303\n    cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authentication logic implementation** (CWE-303), which leads to a potential impact on service confidentiality. The root cause is the **improper authentication logic implementation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-303 as the primary weakness due to the **improper authentication logic implementation** described in the vulnerability. This is further supported by the CVE reference link content summary, which explicitly mentions the same **weakness**.\n\nThe retriever results also include CWE-303 with a high score from the dense retriever, further reinforcing this choice. Although CWE-287 \"Improper Authentication\" is listed, the description specifies the **implementation** of authentication logic, pointing to CWE-303 being a more precise fit.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-303** is the most appropriate because the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"**improper authentication logic implementation**,\" indicating an error in how the authentication algorithm was implemented rather than a complete absence of authentication. The **rootcause** explicitly states the implementation is the problem. The description of CWE-303 fits this scenario perfectly.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.55\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-287: Improper Authentication\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
