When two SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to resume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is interrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock. To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and cant be a standard SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.",
