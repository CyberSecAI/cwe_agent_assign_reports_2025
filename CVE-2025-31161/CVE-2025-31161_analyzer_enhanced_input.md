## Vulnerability Description
CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access. A ****race condition**** exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a ****race condition****, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-31161:

**Content from attackerkb.com_b38f765e_20250624_211421.html (text)**

*   **Relevance:** The content relates to CVE-2025-2825, which is a duplicate of CVE-2025-31161.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text references a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-2825. This vulnerability allows for a web service authentication bypass that affects CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. By exploiting the S3 authentication mechanism, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the server.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is in the S3 authorization method in CrushFTP's HTTP component. It's due to a logic flaw where the *anyPass* parameter doesn't require a password check if set to *true*.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to an authentication bypass, giving the attacker administrative access to the CrushFTP server. This can result in remote code execution in a root or LocalSystem context.
    *   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP request with a crafted "Authorization" header.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know a valid username and the format for the crafted "Authorization" header.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The text suggests patching to CrushFTP versions 10.8.4 or 11.3.1 and later. It also recommends enabling the DMZ perimeter network option as a workaround if immediate patching isn't possible.

*   **Additional Information**: This content provides more detail than the official CVE description regarding root cause, impact, and attack vectors.

**Content from projectdiscovery.io_a79797cd_20250624_202110.html (text)**

*   **Relevance:** The content relates to CVE-2025-31161.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `loginCheckHeaderAuth()` method in `ServerSessionHTTP.java` in CrushFTP's S3 authentication. The `lookup_user_pass` flag, which determined whether a password was required, was passed to the `login_user_pass()` function. This allowed for authentication bypass.
    *   **Vulnerable versions:** Versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access, including administrative actions.
    *   **Attack vector:** Crafting an HTTP request with a specific format for authorization.
    *   **Proof of concept:** The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploitation.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** CrushFTP fixed the vulnerability by: (1) Adding a new security parameter, `s3_auth_lookup_password_supported`, set to false by default, and (2) Adding a security check. (3) Reorganizing the authentication flow.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

---

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
