  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `ima_eventdigest_init_common` function within the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. This function is used to initialize a digest in an IMA event. When a digest is not present (e.g., during a violation measurement), the function attempts to make room for it by increasing an offset. This offset is incremented by the digest size based on the provided `hash_algo`. However, the code was calling  `ima_eventdigest_init_common` with `HASH_ALGO__LAST` which is used as an index into the `hash_digest_size` array which would lead to a buffer over-read and write.\n\n**Vulnerability:**\n- **Buffer Overrun:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overrun. By calling `ima_eventdigest_init_common` with  `HASH_ALGO__LAST` which is outside the bounds of the `hash_digest_size` array, the code would perform a read outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer over-read and subsequent buffer-overrun when attempting to write with this invalid size.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overrun could lead to memory corruption, potentially overwriting critical kernel data.\n- **System Instability:** This corruption could result in system crashes, unpredictable behavior, and denial of service.\n- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, carefully crafted memory corruption can be used to gain elevated privileges, although the information does not give specific details how this can be achieved with this vulnerability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when creating an IMA event, specifically during violation measurements where a digest is not present\n- The `ima_eventdigest_init_common` function is called with  `HASH_ALGO__LAST`\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to trigger an IMA event where the digest is absent, typically a violation measurement, and cause the `ima_eventdigest_init_common` to be called with `HASH_ALGO__LAST`. This can be achieved by actions that would trigger IMA policy violations.\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to cause an IMA event that triggers the vulnerable code path. This may involve certain system operations or modifying files in a way that triggers the configured IMA policy.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The fix introduces a conditional statement to handle the `HASH_ALGO__LAST` case. If the hash algorithm is not specified or invalid (`hash_algo < HASH_ALGO__LAST`), the code will increase the offset by the size of either SHA1 or MD5 digest size.\n\nThis vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix.",

This leads to **CWE-125** (Out-of-bounds Read) when attempting to read the digest size. The subsequent write using the invalid size leads to a **buffer overrun**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability involves a buffer over-read due to accessing an array with an out-of-bounds index.

The evidence supporting this is \"ima_eventdigest_init() calls ima_eventdigest_init_common() with HASH_ALGO__LAST which is then used to access the array hash_digest_size[] leading to **buffer overrun**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states, \"By calling `ima_eventdigest_init_common` with  `HASH_ALGO__LAST` which is outside the bounds of the `hash_digest_size` array, the code would perform a read outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer over-read and subsequent buffer-overrun when attempting to write with this invalid size.\"\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')), and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), but these are less precise than CWE-125. CWE-119 is too general (Class level), and CWE-120 is specific to buffer copies. CWE-787 refers to writing out of bounds, which is a consequence of the initial out-of-bounds read in this case.\n\nCWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) is considered as a secondary candidate since the root cause is the function `ima_eventdigest_init_common` is called with `HASH_ALGO__LAST` which is outside the bounds of the `hash_digest_size` array. This could be due to an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size or a **missing** check on the input before calling `ima_eventdigest_init_common`.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
