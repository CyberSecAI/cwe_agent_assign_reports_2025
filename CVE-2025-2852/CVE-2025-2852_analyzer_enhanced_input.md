## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## SQL Injection Vulnerability in /ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The application does not properly sanitize user input for the `id` parameter in the URL `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=<id>`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially:

*   Retrieve sensitive database information, including the database version (demonstrated in the PoC).
*   Modify or delete data in the database.
*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP request manipulation: Modifying the `id` parameter in the URL `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=<id>` with a crafted SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated as an administrator (username: admin, password: admin123).
*   Ability to craft a malicious SQL query.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.
*   Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize the `id` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters (e.g., integers).
*   Least privilege principle: Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.

**Payload Example:**

`http://localhost/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=xxx'+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,group_concat("result:+",version())--+-`

This payload retrieves the database version.
