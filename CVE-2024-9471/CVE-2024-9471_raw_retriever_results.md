# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-9471
## Query
A privilege escalation (PE) vulnerability in the XML API of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an authenticated PAN-OS administrator with restricted privileges to use a compromised XML API key to perform actions as a higher privileged PAN-OS administrator. For example, an administrator with Virtual system administrator (read-only) access could use an XML API key of a Virtual system administrator to perform write operations on the virtual system configuration even though they should be limited to read-only operations.
