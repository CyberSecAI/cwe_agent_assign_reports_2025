The issue exists in the API endpoint /embed/embedId/stream-chat where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma librarys where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {sessionId{nota}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table. This can lead to unauthorized access to all user queries in embedded chat mode. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-183 CWE-94 CWE-941 CWE-943 CWE-306 CWE-502 CWE-359 CWE-1427 CWE-863 CWE-347",
