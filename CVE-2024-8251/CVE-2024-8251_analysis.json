  "description": "A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint /embed/embedId/stream-chat where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma librarys where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {sessionId{nota}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table. This can lead to unauthorized access to all user queries in embedded chat mode.",

The commit message states \"pre-validate sessionID type for embed chats\". \n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe code did not validate the type of the `sessionId` before using it, potentially leading to issues if an invalid session ID was provided.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nLack of input validation for `sessionId`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact isn't explicitly stated, but an invalid `sessionId` could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or potentially security vulnerabilities if the session ID is used in security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nProviding an invalid `sessionId` as part of a request.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application with a crafted `sessionId`. No authentication is required to exploit this.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe commit adds validation to ensure that the `sessionId` is a string and a valid UUID using the `uuid` library's `validate` function. If the `sessionId` is invalid, the server responds with a 404 error and an \"Invalid session ID\" message.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, as it shows the specific code changes made to address the issue.",

This is a child of CWE-20 \"Improper Input Validation\". The vulnerability description indicates that the provided JSON object, specifically the `sessionId`, is not properly validated before being used in a Prisma query.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of input validation** (CWE-1284). This leads to the ability to inject a specially crafted JSON object into the Prisma query, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to user queries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis identified CWE-1284 \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\" as the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the lack of input validation for the `sessionId` allows for a specially crafted JSON object to be injected, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes from the vulnerability description: \"The issue exists in the API endpoint /embed/embedId/stream-chat where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma librarys where clause.
