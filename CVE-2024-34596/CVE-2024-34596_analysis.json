The retriever results suggested other authorization-related CWEs like CWE-863, CWE-285, and CWE-639, however, the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"**Improper authentication**\". CWE-287 is a class-level CWE and has child CWEs but none appear to be a better fit based on the description. CWE-613 is included as a secondary candidate due to the bypass of expiration date.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe613 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe613 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper authentication** (CWE-287), leading to the bypass of the expiration date for members. The insufficient session expiration may be present, which allows the bypass to occur (CWE-613).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper authentication** as the root cause. The retriever results reinforced this selection. The guidance for Authentication vs Authorization confirmed that since the vulnerability description specifically mentioned \"**Improper authentication**\", a CWE related to authentication is more appropriate. The \"**rootcause:** **Improper authentication**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section is direct evidence. The \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication\" phrase in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section provides additional direct evidence. The selection of CWE-287 as the primary weakness is justified by this evidence.\n\nCWE-613 is a secondary candidate given the expiration date is bypassed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
