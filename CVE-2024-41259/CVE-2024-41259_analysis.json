This could lead to denial of service or data manipulation depending on the service's reliance on the avatar.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe vulnerability can be exploited by using the MD5 algorithm to generate a collision with the target user's email address and using it to modify avatar information.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to:\n   - Control an email address that can be used to generate an MD5 hash collision\n   - Have some knowledge of the hashing algorithm used for avatar URL generation\n   - Ability to utilize the generated hash to modify gravatar information.",

This leads to the potential for hash collisions, which allows attackers to manipulate user account information.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash\n  - **Impact:** Manipulation of user account information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is considered a **weak hashing algorithm**, within the Gravatars service of Navidrome v0.52.3. This allows attackers to potentially manipulate user account information. The primary CWE is CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), as it directly addresses the **root cause** of using MD5. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a related, more general CWE, and could be considered as a secondary classification. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is also considered since MD5 is often associated with password hashing.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases clearly states: \"**rootcause:** **insecure hashing algorithm**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms: \"Navidrome v0.52.3 uses the MD5 **hashing algorithm** to generate URLs for Gravatar avatars instead of the more secure SHA-256 algorithm.\"\n\nThe retriever results also show that CWE-328 is the top combined result.\n\nCWE-328 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\nCWE-327 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is less preferred.\nCWE-916 is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) was considered but deemed less relevant as the primary issue is the weakness of the hash function itself, not the randomness of the input values.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
