This strongly suggests that data is being written outside the intended memory boundaries. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a specific type of memory corruption, and the vulnerability description aligns well with this specific type. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-787 as the most likely candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of an input message, which leads to **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nInput Message -> **Memory Corruption** (CWE-787)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The phrase \"**memory corruption**\" is the key indicator for the **weakness**.
