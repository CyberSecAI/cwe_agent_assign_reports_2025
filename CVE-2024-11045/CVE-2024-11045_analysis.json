  "description": "A **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking** (CSWSH) vulnerability in automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui version 1.10.0 allows an attacker to clone a malicious server extension from a GitHub repository. The vulnerability arises from the **lack of proper validation on WebSocket connections** at ws//127.0.0.17860/queue/join, enabling unauthorized actions on the server. This can lead to unauthorized cloning of server extensions, execution of malicious scripts, data exfiltration, and potential denial of service (DoS).",

This parent-child relationship guided the selection toward the more specific Variant. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered due to the potential for denial of service, which is a consequence of the primary weakness, but it was deemed a secondary impact rather than a root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1385 primary\n    class cwe346,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation on WebSocket connections** (CWE-1385), which allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions. These actions can lead to cloning malicious server extensions, executing malicious scripts, data exfiltration, and ultimately, a denial of service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the key phrase \"**lack of proper validation on WebSocket connections**\" which directly points to CWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets). This is a Variant-level CWE, making it more specific than its parent, CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error). The retriever results also listed CWE-1385 as the top match. While other CWEs like CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) were considered due to the DoS impact, CWE-1385 represents the root cause of the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-1385 is the optimal and most specific representation of the weakness based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a WebSocket, but it does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
