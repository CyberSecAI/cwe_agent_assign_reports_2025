The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation on WebSocket connections at ws//127.0.0.17860/queue/join, enabling unauthorized actions on the server. This can lead to unauthorized cloning of server extensions, execution of malicious scripts, data exfiltration, and potential denial of service (DoS).
