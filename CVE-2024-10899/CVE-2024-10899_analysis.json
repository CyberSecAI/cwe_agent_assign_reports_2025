  "description": "The The WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.6. This is due to the software **allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. The same id parameter is vulnerable to Reflected **Cross-Site Scripting** as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10899:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided content, especially from the Wordfence article, explicitly mentions CVE-2024-10899 and describes vulnerabilities in \"WooCommerce Product Table Lite <= 3.8.6\" that align with the CVE description (although the CVE description is a placeholder here). The Wordfence article details an Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution and a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which are further supported by the identified vulnerable code from trac.wordpress.org.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The plugin allows the execution of WordPress shortcodes via user-supplied input in the `$_REQUEST['id']` parameter without proper sanitization or validation. The plugin directly passes this parameter to `do_shortcode()` on line 1778 in `main.php`\n*   **Reflected XSS:** The plugin uses the `$_REQUEST['id']` parameter which is user-controlled directly in the `do_shortcode()` without sanitation, leading to a potential reflected XSS vulnerability.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:**  The plugin fails to sanitize and validate the `id` parameter before passing it to the `do_shortcode()` function.\n*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin echoes unsanitized user input from the `id` parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript into the page\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary shortcodes, potentially leading to various malicious actions including:\n    *   Inserting malicious content into pages.\n    *   Redirecting users to external malicious sites.\n    *   Data exfiltration.\n*   **Reflected XSS:**  Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code to steal cookies or other sensitive information of logged-in users or perform other malicious actions.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Request**: Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing a malicious shortcode in the `id` parameter.\n*   **Direct use of the AJAX endpoints:** The vulnerable code is reachable through `wc_ajax_wcpt_ajax` (and `wp_ajax_wcpt_ajax`) allowing a direct route for exploitation.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any valid credentials on the WordPress site, making it a highly severe security risk.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.\n\n**Additional Information from the Content (Beyond CVE description):**\n\n*   The provided code diffs in the changeset ([3190789](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3190789%40wc-product-table-lite&new=3190789%40wc-product-table-lite&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=)) show how the vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.7. The fix consists of:\n    *   Explicitly casting the `$_REQUEST['id']` parameter to an integer and ensuring the resulting integer is used to retrieve data.\n    *   Adding a regular expression sanitization for the shortcode attributes, using `preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s=\\-\\_\"\\']/', '', $sc_attrs);`\n\n*   The code before the fix in `main.php` (from [3.8.6 source](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wc-product-table-lite/tags/3.8.6/main.php#L1778)) shows the direct and unsafe usage of `$_REQUEST['id']` in the `do_shortcode` function call\n```php\necho do_shortcode('[product_table id=\"' . $_REQUEST['id'] . '\" ' . $sc_attrs . ' ]');\n```\n\n*   The changelog in `readme.txt` indicates that version 3.8.7 includes a security vulnerability fix.",

The evidence from the vulnerability description, CVE reference links content summary, and retriever results supports this assessment. The retriever results highlighted CWE-79, CWE-96 as strong candidates.
