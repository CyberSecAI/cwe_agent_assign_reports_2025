## Vulnerability Description
The Collapse-O-Matic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins expand and expandsub shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.5.7 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** inject arbitrary web scripts
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Collapse-O-Matic plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.8.5.7
- **component:** expand and expandsub shortcode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4095:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2024-4095 and details a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Collapse-O-Matic plugin. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of user-supplied attributes within the plugin's `expand` and `expandsub` shortcodes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within shortcode attributes (like `title`, `alt`, etc.). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
-  **Inadequate Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't sufficiently escape the attribute values before rendering them on the page. This allows the injected script to execute when the page is viewed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies or authentication tokens, leading to account compromise.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could inject malicious code that redirects users to malware download sites.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the affected website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** The primary attack vector is injecting malicious JavaScript within the attributes of the `[expand]` or `[expandsub]` shortcodes.
- **WordPress Content:** The injected shortcode would be placed within WordPress content such as posts, pages, or widgets.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website. This allows them to create/edit posts or pages and include the malicious shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `shortcode` function in `collapse-o-matic.php`, specifically where shortcode attributes are processed and included in the HTML output.
- The fix involves using `esc_attr()` to properly escape the shortcode attributes (as seen in the Trac changeset: `esc_attr($id)`).
- The vulnerable code appears around line 343 in the `collapse-o-matic.php` file.
- The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 1.8.5.8

**Additional Information:**

- The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin directory due to this security issue.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on June 14, 2024.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jack Taylor of Wordfence Intelligence.
- The provided content also highlights the importance of proper input sanitization and output escaping in web applications.
- A fix has been applied to the id attribute.
