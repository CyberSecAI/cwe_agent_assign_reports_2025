  "description": "Finit is a fast init for Linux systems. Versions starting from 3.0-rc1 and prior to version 4.11 bundle an implementation of getty for the `tty` configuration directive that can bypass `/bin/login`, i.e., a user can log in as any user without authentication. This issue has been patched in version 4.11.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-29906 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-29906. It details a vulnerability in the `finit` project where a bundled `getty` implementation can bypass `/bin/login`, allowing a user to log in as any user without authentication.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    The vulnerability stems from the bundled `getty` implementation in `finit` versions v3.0-rc1 and later. This `getty` implementation doesn't properly secure the login process, allowing bypass of `/bin/login`.\n\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - Bypass of authentication mechanism (`/bin/login`).\n    - Insecure implementation of `getty`.\n\n* **Impact of exploitation:**\n    An attacker can log in as any user without authentication. This leads to high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.\n\n* **Attack vectors:**\n    Local. The CVSS score indicates a local attack vector.\n\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    User interaction is required (UI:R). The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system's login process. No privileges are required (PR:N).\n\n* **Mitigation or fix:**\n    - Upgrade to `finit` version 4.11 or later.\n    - Use an external `getty` implementation (e.g., `agetty` from the distribution) as a workaround.  Example configuration: `tty [12345] /sbin/agetty /dev/ttyAMA0 xterm noclear`.\n\n* **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High)\n* **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifically detailing the impact, mitigation, and CVSS scoring.",

The analysis also considered chain relationships, specifically how missing authentication can lead to other vulnerabilities. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) was considered as a related weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** in the `getty` implementation. This allows a user to bypass the `/bin/login` authentication process, ultimately leading to unauthorized access as any user.\n\n  - Root Cause: CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n  - Impact: Bypass of /bin/login leading to unauthorized access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of authentication** in the bundled `getty` implementation. The retriever results highlighted CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as a strong candidate, and the vulnerability description directly supports this classification. The evidence from the CVE description, specifically the phrase \"bypass `/bin/login`, i.e., a user can log in as any user without authentication,\" directly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-306.\n\nThe graph relationships, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-306 and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), further solidified the choice of CWE-306 as the more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. While CWE-287 is a broader category, CWE-306 pinpoints the exact issue of missing authentication for a critical function.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **absence of authentication** for a critical function. This allows for a clear understanding of the weakness and facilitates targeted mitigation efforts.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
