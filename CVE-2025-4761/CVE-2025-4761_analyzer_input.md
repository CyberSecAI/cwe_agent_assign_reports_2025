## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

This content **relates** to a potential vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the CVE description itself. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Complaint Management System" project V2.0. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the "mobilenumber" parameter in the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Complete system control
*   Service disruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the "mobilenumber" parameter in a POST request to `/admin/admin-profile.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Employ prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Conduct input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with only the necessary privileges.

**Payload Example:**

```
