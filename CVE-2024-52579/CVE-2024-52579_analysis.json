  "description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Some APIs using `HttpRequestService` do not properly check the target host. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send POST or GET requests to the internal server, which may result in a SSRF attack.It allows an attacker to send POST or GET requests (with some controllable URL parameters) to private IPs, enabling further attacks on internal servers. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

An attacker sends crafted requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

Other CWEs, such as CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], were considered due to their potential relevance but ultimately deemed less directly applicable. CWE-918 stands out due to the **improper host checking** leading directly to the possibility of sending requests to internal servers. There are no strong parent-child relationships in this case influencing the selection, but the chain from **improper validation** to SSRF is clear.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe918\n    cwe306\n    cwe639\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper host checking**, which leads to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and ultimately allows an attacker to send requests to internal servers.\n\nImproper Host Checking -> SSRF -> Access to Internal Servers\n\nThe **rootcause** is the **improper host checking**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that **improper host checking** in the `HttpRequestService` leads to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability description states, \"Some APIs using `HttpRequestService` do not properly check the target host. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send POST or GET requests to the internal server, which may result in a SSRF attack.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)].\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the final selection, as CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)] was the most direct and accurate representation of the vulnerability. While CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] were considered, they were deemed less central to the core issue of SSRF.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause and resulting vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
