## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a bug in the OAuth2 Device Code flow implementation within the authentik application. Specifically, access restrictions defined for an application were not being enforced during the device code flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks during the OAuth2 Device Code flow. This allowed users to potentially obtain OAuth tokens for applications without having the necessary permissions.
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** This CWE accurately describes the core of the vulnerability, where the system fails to restrict access to authorized users.
- **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization):** The system fails to properly authorize requests, allowing unauthorized users to obtain access tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation would allow users to bypass intended access controls and obtain OAuth tokens for applications that they should not be authorized to access.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive resources protected by the affected applications.
- **Integrity Loss:** There is potential for the attacker to modify data/resources within the application, since access control was bypassed.
- **Availability Loss:** There is a potential risk of a denial of service since the attacker can now perform operations they normally would not be authorized for.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **OAuth2 Device Code Flow:** The vulnerability specifically resides within the OAuth2 Device Code flow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker does not need any existing privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without requiring any interaction from a user.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively straightforward to execute, requiring minimal effort from the attacker.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L**
    - **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
    - **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    - **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not change the scope of the system.
    - **C:H (High):** There is a high potential impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:L (Low):** There is a low potential impact on integrity.
    - **A:L (Low):** There is a low potential impact on availability.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in authentik versions 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3, and 2024.2.4.

**Workarounds:**
- While updating is recommended, a workaround involves adding access control to the configured flows within authentik. This is because the authentik flows are still used as part of the OAuth2 Device Code flow.

**Summary**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of access controls during the OAuth2 Device Code flow in the authentik application. This lack of access control enforcement could allow unauthorized users to gain access to protected resources. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, does not require any privileges or user interaction, and is considered to have a high impact on confidentiality, with low potential impact on integrity and availability. Patched versions are available.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

### Extended Description


When a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.


Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-913

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of "code execution," which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.
**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Frequent Misinterpretation



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.
