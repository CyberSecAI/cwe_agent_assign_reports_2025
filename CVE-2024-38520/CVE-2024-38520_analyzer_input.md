# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38520

## Vulnerability Description
SoftEtherVPN is a an open-source cross-platform multi-protocol VPN Program. When SoftEtherVPN is deployed with L2TP enabled on a device, it introduces the possibility of the host being used for amplification/reflection traffic generation because it will respond to every packet with two response packets that are larger than the request packet size. These sorts of techniques are used by external actors who generate spoofed source IPs to target a destination on the internet. This vulnerability has been patched in version 5.02.5185.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** amplification/reflection traffic generation
- **attacker:** external actors
- **product:** SoftEtherVPN
- **version:** prior to 5.02.5185
- **component:** L2TP

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the SoftEther VPN server's behavior when it receives an ISAKMP packet with a non-zero `init_cookie` field (Init SPI) on the UDP port 4500.
- When no matching IPsec Security Association (SA) is found for the received packet, the server sends two response packets: an "Informational Exchange Packet" and a "Delete IPsec SA Packet". This behavior results in amplification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **UDP Amplification/Reflection:** The server responds to invalid ISAKMP packets with two larger packets, creating an amplification effect.
- **Lack of SA Check:** The server doesn't discard packets when no matching SA exists. Instead, it generates responses, contributing to the amplification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DDoS Amplification:** Attackers can use the vulnerable server as a reflector to amplify their traffic by sending spoofed packets to the server, which then sends the amplified responses to the intended victim.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The VPN server's resources can be overwhelmed by the volume of response packets, leading to potential service disruption for legitimate users.
- **Targeted DDoS Attacks:** The amplified responses can be directed towards specific target IPs, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network via UDP port 4500.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted ISAKMP packet with a non-zero `init_cookie` to the vulnerable SoftEther VPN server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the SoftEther VPN server.
- No specific authentication is required
- No specific privileges are required
- No user interaction required

**Additional Details:**
- The amplification factor is about 2.75x (a 56-byte packet results in 156-byte response).
- The vulnerability affects SoftEther VPN versions up to and including 5.02.5184.
- The fix is included in version 5.02.5185, which ignores packets with no IPsec SA
- The vulnerability was reported by Jonathan Phillibert from Amazon Web Services
- The fix was pushed to the Developer Edition of SoftEther VPN and will be pushed to the stable version after testing

**CVSS Score:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Moderate).
- The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended mitigation is to update to version 5.02.5185 or later.
- The code should be updated so that a packet received to udp/4500 by the SoftEtherVPN server would result in no emitted responses if an SA was not (at least partially) matched.
