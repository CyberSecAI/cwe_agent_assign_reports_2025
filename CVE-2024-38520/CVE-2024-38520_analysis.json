  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-38520",
  "description": "SoftEtherVPN is a an open-source cross-platform multi-protocol VPN Program. When SoftEtherVPN is deployed with L2TP enabled on a device, it introduces the possibility of the host being used for amplification/reflection traffic generation because it will respond to every packet with two response packets that are larger than the request packet size. These sorts of techniques are used by external actors who generate spoofed source IPs to target a destination on the internet. This vulnerability has been patched in version 5.02.5185.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38520:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the SoftEther VPN server's behavior when it receives an ISAKMP packet with a non-zero `init_cookie` field (Init SPI) on the UDP port 4500.\n- When no matching IPsec Security Association (SA) is found for the received packet, the server sends two response packets: an \"Informational Exchange Packet\" and a \"Delete IPsec SA Packet\". This behavior results in amplification.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **UDP Amplification/Reflection:** The server responds to invalid ISAKMP packets with two larger packets, creating an amplification effect.\n- **Lack of SA Check:** The server doesn't discard packets when no matching SA exists. Instead, it generates responses, contributing to the amplification.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **DDoS Amplification:** Attackers can use the vulnerable server as a reflector to amplify their traffic by sending spoofed packets to the server, which then sends the amplified responses to the intended victim.\n- **Resource Exhaustion:** The VPN server's resources can be overwhelmed by the volume of response packets, leading to potential service disruption for legitimate users.\n- **Targeted DDoS Attacks:** The amplified responses can be directed towards specific target IPs, leading to a denial-of-service attack.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is over the network via UDP port 4500.\n- The attacker sends a specially crafted ISAKMP packet with a non-zero `init_cookie` to the vulnerable SoftEther VPN server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the SoftEther VPN server.\n- No specific authentication is required\n- No specific privileges are required\n- No user interaction required\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The amplification factor is about 2.75x (a 56-byte packet results in 156-byte response).\n- The vulnerability affects SoftEther VPN versions up to and including 5.02.5184.\n- The fix is included in version 5.02.5185, which ignores packets with no IPsec SA\n- The vulnerability was reported by Jonathan Phillibert from Amazon Web Services\n- The fix was pushed to the Developer Edition of SoftEther VPN and will be pushed to the stable version after testing\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Moderate).\n- The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The recommended mitigation is to update to version 5.02.5185 or later.\n- The code should be updated so that a packet received to udp/4500 by the SoftEtherVPN server would result in no emitted responses if an SA was not (at least partially) matched.",

While it is a Class, there are no suitable Base or Variant level children that fully capture the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-941 and CWE-770 were considered as contributing factors. CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel) relates to the destination of the packets and could be a contributing factor, but is not the primary weakness. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) could be considered as the server allocates resources to generate the amplified response without limits, it is not the main issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe406[\"CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe941 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe406\n    cwe770 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe406\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe406 primary\n    class cwe941,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the SoftEtherVPN server receiving a crafted ISAKMP packet. Because of the **lack of SA check**, the server **incorrectly specifies the destination** and generates two response packets, larger than the request, leading to **insufficient control of network message volume**, which leads to **amplification/reflection traffic generation**, causing a DDoS amplification attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, especially the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states \"UDP Amplification/Reflection\" as a weakness. The vulnerability description also highlights \"amplification/reflection traffic generation\" as the impact. This leads to selecting CWE-406, which directly addresses this weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-406 with a high score. Although CWE-406 is a Class, there isn't a more specific CWE that fits better.\n\nCWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel) could be a contributing factor, as the crafted packet leads to the server sending responses to unintended destinations, but the core issue is the amplification.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) could also be considered as a contributing factor because the server allocates resources to generate the amplified response without limits, however, this isn't the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently monitor or control transmitted network traffic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to transmit more traffic than should be allowed for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
