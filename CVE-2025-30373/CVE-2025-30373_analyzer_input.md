# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-30373

## Vulnerability Description
Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting with 6.1, HTTP Inputs can be configured to check if a specified header is present and has a specified value to authenticate HTTP-based ingestion. Unfortunately, even though in cases of a missing header or a wrong value the correct HTTP response (401) is returned, the message will be ingested nonetheless. To mitigate the vulnerability, disable http-based inputs and allow only authenticated pull-based inputs. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.1.9.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** ingest message even in cases of missing header or wrong value
- **product:** Graylog
- **version:** 6.1 to 6.1.8
- **component:** HTTP Inputs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-30373 based on provided content:

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-30373 and provides significantly more detail than the placeholder description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

HTTP Inputs in Graylog, starting with version 6.1, incorrectly ingest messages even when the authentication header is missing or has an incorrect value, despite returning a 401 Unauthorized response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Incorrect authentication handling in HTTP inputs.
*   Failure to prevent message ingestion when authentication fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can potentially ingest messages into Graylog without proper authentication, potentially leading to log spoofing or data injection.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based attack.
*   Sending HTTP requests to the Graylog HTTP input endpoint without a valid Authorization header or with an incorrect value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the Graylog HTTP input endpoint.
*   No privileges required.
*   No user interaction required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to Graylog version 6.1.9 or later.
*   Workaround: Disable HTTP-based inputs and only allow authenticated pull-based inputs.

**CVSS Score:** 6.5 / 10 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected versions:** >= 6.1.0

**Patched versions:** >= 6.1.9
