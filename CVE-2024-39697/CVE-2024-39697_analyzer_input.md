# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39697

## Vulnerability Description
phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. Since 0.3.4, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a **panic-guarded out-of-bounds access** on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAAphone-context=AA`, where the number part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.6.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **panic-guarded out-of-bounds access**
- **impact:** panic
- **product:** phonenumber
- **version:** Since 0.3.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39697:

**1. Verification:**
The content clearly relates to CVE-2024-39697. The provided GitHub security advisory (GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687) explicitly states that it corresponds to CVE-2024-39697.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from an `assert!` statement within the `NationalNumber::new` function. This assertion checked if the provided numerical value was less than 2^56 (56 bits).
   - The `NationalNumber` struct was modified to store the national number and leading zeros in a single `u64` field, where the leading zeros are stored in the higher bits, and the number itself in the lower bits. This optimization required the assertion.
   - The `assert!` caused the program to panic when processing a crafted phone number where the numerical part, after parsing, exceeded the 56-bit limit.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unchecked Input:** The `NationalNumber::new` function, while intended for internal use with trusted input, was indirectly reachable by parsing untrusted strings, leading to a panic.
   - **Use of `assert!`:** The usage of `assert!` for input validation resulted in a denial-of-service vulnerability. Assertions are intended to catch internal programming errors and should not be used for handling invalid user input, as they cause the program to panic.
   - **Implicit Trust:**  The code implicitly trusted the input to `NationalNumber::new`, assuming it would always be a valid value.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A maliciously crafted phone number string could cause a program using the library to crash.
   - The vulnerability could be triggered remotely by an attacker if the crafted phone number was processed over a network.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by passing a crafted string to the parsing function, which then converts this string into a large number that goes past the assertion in the `NationalNumber::new` function.
   - **String Parsing:** The attack vector involves exploiting the string parsing logic of the library to create phone numbers with national numbers that, when converted to a numeric value, exceed the 56-bit limit.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker must be able to provide an arbitrary phone number string to be parsed by the vulnerable library.
   - **No Special Privileges:** The attack can be performed without requiring any specific privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in version 0.3.4 of the library with the change to store national numbers in 64 bits.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.3.6 by replacing the `assert!` with an explicit error return.
- Property-based testing was used to discover the problematic code path that triggered the panic.
- A crafted example of a malicious string is `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, which when parsed resulted in a number greater than 56 bits, triggering the assertion.
- The commit `f69abee` introduced the vulnerable code.
- The commit `b792151` fixed the vulnerability.
- The fix involved replacing the `assert!` with a `Result` and returning an error when the national number is too long.
- The vulnerable code is in `src/national_number.rs` and the fix is also in the same file.
