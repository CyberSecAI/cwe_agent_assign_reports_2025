# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-13111

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Beijing Yunfan Internet Technology Yunfan Learning Examination System 1.9.2. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file src/main/java/com/yf/exam/modules/sys/user/controller/SysUserControl of the component JWT Token Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper authentication**. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authentication**
- **product:** Beijing Yunfan Internet Technology Yunfan Learning Examination System
- **version:** 1.9.2
- **component:** src/main/java/com/yf/exam/modules/sys/user/controller/SysUserControl

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to invalidate or remove JWT (JSON Web Tokens) upon user logout.
- The same JWT can be used across different instances of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JWT Reuse:**  The application doesn't invalidate JWTs upon logout, leading to them being perpetually valid.
- **Universal JWT:** The JWT is not tied to a specific user session, allowing it to be used by any user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker can use a leaked or intercepted valid JWT to bypass authentication and gain administrator-level access to the application and associated resources. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or complete system takeover.
- **Widespread Impact:** The vulnerability affects all instances of the application due to the universal nature of the JWT.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:**  An attacker could intercept a JWT in transit, particularly if the traffic is not encrypted.
- **Leaked Tokens:**  If a valid JWT is somehow made public (e.g. through logging, or insecure storage) it can be used by an attacker.
- **Replay Attacks**: If a user logs out but the token is still valid, this allows an attacker to use the same token and potentially log back in as that user.
- **Direct API Access**: With a valid JWT, an attacker can directly make API requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs a valid JWT. This can be obtained through network interception, leakage, or by capturing one during an actual login.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is based on a GitHub issue report which provides more technical details and a proof of concept, going into more detail than a standard CVE description.
- The attacker uses a fixed JWT (eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MzQ5NTQ2NjEsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoicGVyc29uIn0.6tEVOLvOYme17vn8p4UF2mTG2oxwtCPgHzgQ7Fxmga4) to gain access and send a POST request to `/exam/api/sys/user/paging`.
- The code snippet `src/main/java/com/yf/exam/modules/sys/user/controller/SysUserControl.java` is referenced as the location where the vulnerability occurs when a user logs out.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
