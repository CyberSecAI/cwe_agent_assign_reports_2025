It also has a parent-child relationship with CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). The vulnerability description and CVE summary specifically mention \"HTTP header injection,\" making CWE-113 the most relevant. CWE-74 is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities, and while applicable, CWE-113 provides a more specific classification. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose the Variant level CWE-113 because of its specificity to the described vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    cwe74 -->|PARENT OF| cwe113\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe436,cwe93,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper processing of HTTP headers** which results in **HTTP header injection**. This allows an attacker to tamper with URLs in emails sent by the application, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase \"HTTP header injection\" strongly suggests CWE-113. The CVE summary confirms that the product improperly processes HTTP headers. The retriever results also list CWE-113 as the top candidate. While CWE-74 is mentioned in the CVE summary, it is a more general injection vulnerability. CWE-113 provides a more precise classification of the weakness.
