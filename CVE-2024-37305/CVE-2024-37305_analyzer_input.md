# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37305

## Vulnerability Description
oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs. Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unchecked length values**
- **impact:** crashes and information leakage
- **vector:** malformed input
- **product:** OpenSSL
- **version:** before 0.6.1
- **component:** oqs-provider

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of lengths decoded using the `DECODE_UINT32` macro within the `oqs-provider` library. This macro is called on user-provided input without any length checks. The decoded length values are then used for memory reads and writes without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Length Values:** The `DECODE_UINT32` macro decodes user-supplied lengths without any bounds checking.
- **Buffer Overflow:** The unchecked length values are used to perform memory reads and writes, leading to potential buffer overflows if the provided lengths are maliciously crafted.
- **Integer Overflows:** The decoded uint32 values are sometimes loaded into int or other integer types, which could cause integer overflows and related issues, which can be further exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crashes:** Malformed input with invalid length values can lead to crashes due to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to leak sensitive information through unauthorized memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the input of malformed hybrid keys and signatures. Specifically, the lengths encoded at the start of these serialized objects using `DECODE_UINT32` are vulnerable.
- User-provided `char *` input to `oqsx_key_op` and `oqs_sig_verify` are the main areas of concern.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide malformed input containing invalid length values to the affected functions, either as part of a key or signature object.
- No user interaction or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `oqs-provider` versions 0.6.0 and earlier.
- The issue is fixed in version 0.6.1 and later, with the fix including length checks when `DECODE_UINT32` is called on an `OQSX_KEY` hybrid key's private or public key.
- The vulnerability specifically affects hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) key and signature handling. It doesn't affect the handling of plain/non-hybrid post-quantum key operations.
- The provided CVSS v3 base metrics indicate a high availability impact due to crashes, a low confidentiality impact and a network attack vector.
- The identified CWEs associated with the vulnerability include CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input), CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency), CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), CWE-680 (Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow), and CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value).
