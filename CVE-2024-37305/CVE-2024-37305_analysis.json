  "description": "oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs. Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37305:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper handling of lengths decoded using the `DECODE_UINT32` macro within the `oqs-provider` library. This macro is called on user-provided input without any length checks. The decoded length values are then used for memory reads and writes without sufficient validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Unchecked Length Values:** The `DECODE_UINT32` macro decodes user-supplied lengths without any bounds checking.\n- **Buffer Overflow:** The unchecked length values are used to perform memory reads and writes, leading to potential buffer overflows if the provided lengths are maliciously crafted.\n- **Integer Overflows:** The decoded uint32 values are sometimes loaded into int or other integer types, which could cause integer overflows and related issues, which can be further exploited.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Crashes:** Malformed input with invalid length values can lead to crashes due to out-of-bounds memory access.\n- **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to leak sensitive information through unauthorized memory access.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is through the input of malformed hybrid keys and signatures. Specifically, the lengths encoded at the start of these serialized objects using `DECODE_UINT32` are vulnerable.\n- User-provided `char *` input to `oqsx_key_op` and `oqs_sig_verify` are the main areas of concern.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to provide malformed input containing invalid length values to the affected functions, either as part of a key or signature object.\n- No user interaction or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in `oqs-provider` versions 0.6.0 and earlier.\n- The issue is fixed in version 0.6.1 and later, with the fix including length checks when `DECODE_UINT32` is called on an `OQSX_KEY` hybrid key's private or public key.\n- The vulnerability specifically affects hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) key and signature handling. It doesn't affect the handling of plain/non-hybrid post-quantum key operations.\n- The provided CVSS v3 base metrics indicate a high availability impact due to crashes, a low confidentiality impact and a network attack vector.\n- The identified CWEs associated with the vulnerability include CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input), CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency), CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), CWE-680 (Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow), and CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value).",

This can then lead to **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** when the overflown value is used as an index or offset. **CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** reflects the root cause of the problem, where the length is not validated. All three are Base level CWEs and their relationship show how the initial **lack of input validation** can lead to **integer overflows**, and subsequently **out-of-bounds reads**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe190\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**. Since the length parameters from the input are not validated, this can lead to **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, where the length calculation overflows, causing it to wrap around. Finally, this can result in **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read**, because the wrapped around, small value, is used as an index/offset into the buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary cause of the vulnerability is an integer overflow due to unchecked length values, which results in an out-of-bounds read, and a lack of input validation. The vulnerability description mentions \"**unchecked length values** are later used for memory reads and writes malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this, stating \"**Unchecked Length Values:** The `DECODE_UINT32` macro decodes user-supplied lengths without any bounds checking.\" This directly relates to **CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** and **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, and the resulting **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read**.
