CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770, representing the broader category of uncontrolled resource consumption. However, since the specific issue is related to allocation, CWE-770 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled allocation of memory** (CWE-770). This leads to **resource exhaustion** and ultimately a Denial of Service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **out-of-memory error** as the root cause. The content summary confirmed that the **root cause** is attempting to allocate a large block of memory during parsing of ABC data leading to allocator exhaustion. The primary weakness is **insufficient memory allocation handling**. This closely aligns with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), as the system is not limiting the amount of memory being allocated, leading to the exhaustion of available memory. The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service, which maps to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).\n\nThe choice of CWE-770 is preferred over others because it accurately captures the specific mechanism of the vulnerability: the lack of limits on resource allocation. Although other CWEs such as CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) are related, CWE-770 is a more direct representation of the weakness as the size isn't validated.\n\nThe mapping guidance for both CWE-770 and CWE-400 allows their usage. CWE-400 is generally discouraged but can be used to denote the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 1971.46\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1859.20\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1837.19\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1738.60\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1690.25\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.03\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.90\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.28\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.21\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.21\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value):** While the vulnerability does involve memory allocation, the core issue is not necessarily the size being excessive, but rather the lack of any limits on the allocation.
