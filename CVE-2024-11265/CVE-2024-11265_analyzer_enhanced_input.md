## Vulnerability Description
The Increase Maximum Upload File Size | Increase Execution Time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to returning image upload error messages with full path information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Increase Maximum Upload File Size | Increase Execution Time plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11265:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's handling of image upload error messages. Specifically, the plugin returns error messages that include the full server path to the uploaded file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the web application's full path due to the inclusion of file system paths in error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full server path of the web application. This information, while not directly exploitable, can be valuable in reconnaissance for further attacks.
- **Aid in other attacks:** The disclosed path information can be used to facilitate other attacks by revealing the location of important files. This vulnerability would need to be chained with another vulnerability for a successful attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through HTTP requests with malicious image uploads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with "author" level privileges or higher. This is due to the function `wmufs_ajax_chunk_receiver()` requiring the `upload_files` capability.
- **Access to WordPress backend:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress dashboard to trigger the upload functionality.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the `wmufs_ajax_chunk_receiver` function in `/inc/class-wmufs-chunk-files.php`. The issue arises because when an error occurs, the function includes the full path in the error message sent back to the user.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.4 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is described as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
