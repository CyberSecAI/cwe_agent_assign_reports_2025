The password is stored in memory in cleartext. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. An attacker can get hold of the password. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-316, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory, is a specific type of CWE-312, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, which in turn is a child of CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. CWE-316 is a Variant, and CWE-200 is a Class, so CWE-316 is a more specific and appropriate choice than CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe316 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **password stored in memory**. This leads to exposure of the password, which allows an attacker to impersonate a user.\n  - CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory (Root Cause)\n  - CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the password used to log on to an SAP system is stored in memory. This directly matches the description of CWE-316, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory. The vulnerability leads to the possibility of an attacker obtaining the password and impersonating the affected user, which aligns with CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. However, since the root cause is storing the password in cleartext in memory, CWE-316 is the primary and more specific CWE.\n\nI considered CWE-200 because it is listed in the Retriever results and because the vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a high-level class, and CWE-316 provides a more accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe retriever listed several other CWEs, but they do not accurately describe the vulnerability. CWE-94, Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, and CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, are not relevant to the described vulnerability. CWE-311, Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data is similar, but the description is more specific to storing the data in cleartext. CWE-532, Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File, is also not applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is

Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**:
