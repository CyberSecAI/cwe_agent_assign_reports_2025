  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KEYS trusted dcp fix **improper sg use** with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y With vmalloc stack addresses enabled (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y) DCP trusted keys can crash during en- and decryption of the blob encryption key via the DCP crypto driver. This is caused by improperly using sg_init_one() with vmallocd stack buffers (plain_key_blob). Fix this by always using kmalloc() for buffers we give to the DCP crypto driver.",

The vulnerability involves writing data to an incorrect memory location because of the **improper sg use**, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write condition. Given that a more specific CWE (CWE-787) exists, it's preferred over the more general CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper sg use**, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.
