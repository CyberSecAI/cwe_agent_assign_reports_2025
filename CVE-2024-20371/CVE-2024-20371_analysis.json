  "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco Nexus 3550-F Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked to the management interface of an affected device.&nbsp This vulnerability exists because **ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic to the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic to the management interface of the affected device.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-20371:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that Access Control List (ACL) deny rules are not properly enforced on Cisco Nexus 3550-F switches during device reboot. This means that after a reboot, the device may temporarily fail to block traffic as intended by the configured ACL rules.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Improper enforcement of ACL deny rules during device reboot.\n- ACL bypass vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send traffic to the management interface of an affected device that should otherwise be blocked by ACLs.\n- The attacker may gain unauthorized access to the management interface.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Remote attack over the network.\n- The attacker sends traffic that would typically be blocked to the management interface of the device.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to reach the management interface of the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 3550-F switch over the network.\n- No authentication is required.\n- The attacker does not need special privileges.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Nexus 3550-F Switches.\n- Cisco NX-OS software is not affected.\n- There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability; a software update is required.\n- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\n- The base CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium Severity)",

The **ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot**, which is a type of **Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default**. This can lead to other weaknesses such as **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, but the root cause is the insecure initialization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1188\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1188 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1188 **ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot**\n2.  **Weakness:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306) because the device fails to block traffic as intended.\n3.  **Impact:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send traffic to the management interface of an affected device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key phrase, **ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot** pointed towards a problem with how the device initializes its resources. After considering various CWEs, CWE-1188 emerged as the most fitting primary CWE, as it specifically addresses the issue of initializing a resource (in this case, ACL rules) with an insecure default.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that \"ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot.\" This indicates that the ACL rules are not being initialized correctly or are being initialized in a way that does not provide the intended security.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results were helpful in narrowing down the potential CWEs. While CWE-306 was also considered, it was deemed a secondary weakness that arises as a result of the insecure initialization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and a consequence of the vulnerability, providing a clear understanding of the underlying issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default**\n\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability arises because the ACL deny rules are not properly enforced after a device reboot. This means that the ACLs, which are a security resource, are being initialized with an insecure or incomplete configuration. This insecure initialization leads to a state where traffic that should be blocked is not, effectively bypassing the intended security controls.\n    *   **Security Implications and Potential Impact:** The immediate security implication is that an attacker can send unauthorized traffic to the management interface of the device. This could lead to further exploitation, such as gaining unauthorized access, disrupting services, or exfiltrating sensitive information.\n    *   **Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-1188 is a Base-level CWE.\n    *   **Primary/Secondary:** This is the primary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n    *   **MITRE Mapping Guidance:** The usage is ALLOWED, which is in line with MITRE's recommendations for Base-level CWEs.\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\n\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability can lead to a state where traffic that should be blocked isn't, meaning that authentication is effectively bypassed for critical functions related to managing the device.\n    *   **Security Implications and Potential Impact:** The lack of proper ACL enforcement effectively creates a scenario where critical functions are exposed without proper authentication. An attacker could potentially exploit this to perform unauthorized actions on the device.\n    *   **Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-306 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n    *   **Primary/Secondary:** This is a secondary CWE because it is a consequence of the primary weakness, which is the insecure initialization of ACL rules (CWE-1188).\n    *   **MITRE Mapping Guidance:** The usage is ALLOWED, which is in line with MITRE's recommendations for Base-level CWEs.",
