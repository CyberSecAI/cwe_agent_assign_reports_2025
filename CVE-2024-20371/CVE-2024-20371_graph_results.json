  "query": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco Nexus 3550-F Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked to the management interface of an affected device.&nbsp This vulnerability exists because ACL deny rules are not properly enforced at the time of device reboot. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic to the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic to the management interface of the affected device.",
