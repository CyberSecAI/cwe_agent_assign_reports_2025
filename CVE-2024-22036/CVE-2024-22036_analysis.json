  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a cluster or node driver can be used to **escape the chroot jail** and gain root access to the Rancher container itself. In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible based on living off the land within the Rancher container itself. For the test and development environments, based on a privileged Docker container, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system. This issue affects rancher from 2.7.0 before 2.7.16, from 2.8.0 before 2.8.9, from 2.9.0 before 2.9.3.",

  "reference_content": "```\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\n*   During startup, Rancher appends the `/opt/drivers/management-state/bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.\n*   The binaries `/usr/bin/rancher-machine`, `/usr/bin/helm_v3`, and `/usr/bin/kustomize` are assigned a UID of 1001 and a GID of 127 instead of being owned by the root user.\n*   Rancher employs a jail mechanism to isolate the execution of node drivers from the main process. However, the drivers are executed with excessive permissions.\n*   During the registration of new node drivers, its binary is executed with the same user as the parent process, which could enable an attacker to gain elevated privileges by registering a malicious driver.\n*   Lack of validation on the driver file type, which allows symbolic links to be used.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n*   A cluster or node driver can be used to escape the `chroot` jail and gain root access to the Rancher container.\n*   Privilege escalation.\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n*   In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible.\n*   In test and development environments, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system.\n\nAttack vectors:\n*   Registering a malicious driver.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n*   An attacker must be able to register or control a malicious cluster or node driver.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n*   Remove the step that appends `/opt/drivers/management-state/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.\n*   Correct the permission of the binaries `/usr/bin/rancher-machine`, `/usr/bin/helm_v3`, and `/usr/bin/kustomize` so that they are owned by the root user.\n*   A new group `jail-accessors` has been created, and the rancher user has been added to this group.\n*   The `jail-accessors` group is granted read and execute permissions for the directories `/var/lib/rancher`, `/var/lib/cattle`, and `/usr/local/bin`.\n*   The jail mechanism has been enhanced to execute commands using the non-root `rancher` user and the `jail-accessors` group. Additionally, a new setting, `UnprivilegedJailUser`, has been introduced to manage this behavior, allowing users to opt-out if they need to run drivers in a more privileged context.\n*   Limit the devices copied to the jail directory to a minimal set.\n*   The `NewPlugin(driver)` function in the `rancher/machine` module has been updated to allow setting the UID and GID for starting the plugin server. If the environment variables `MACHINE_PLUGIN_UID` and `MACHINE_PLUGIN_GID` are set, their values will be used to configure the user credentials for launching the plugin server.\n*   Rancher now sets these environment variables with a non-root UID and GID before invoking the `NewPlugin(driver)` function and then unsets them after retrieving the creation flags.\n*   The `driver` package has been revised to verify that the downloaded driver binary is a regular file.\n*   The `driver` package has been revised to verify that the target file in the downloaded tar file is a regular file.\n*   The `driver` package now executes the downloaded driver binary within a jail, with a default timeout of 5 seconds.\n*   The helm package has been updated to ensure appropriate permissions are set on the generated kubeconfig file.\n*   The `nodeConfig` package has been updated to ensure proper permissions are applied when extracting the node configuration.\n*   Patched versions include releases `2.7.16`, `2.8.9` and `2.9.3`.\n*   If you can't upgrade to a fixed version, please make sure that:\n    *   Drivers are only executed from trusted sources.\n    *   The use of Admins/Restricted Admins is limited to trusted users.\n```",

This ultimately results in privilege escalation and potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is the **incorrect permission assignment** for critical resources, allowing attackers to **escape the chroot jail** and escalate privileges. This is supported by the CVE reference links, which mention that binaries were assigned incorrect UIDs and GIDs and that the drivers are executed with excessive permissions.\n\nThe initial retriever results pointed to CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While authorization issues might be present, the root cause appears to stem more directly from incorrect permission assignments during the setup and execution of the Rancher environment.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-732 is based on the evidence of incorrect permission assignments for binaries and the excessive permissions granted to drivers. Other CWEs, such as CWE-269 and CWE-250, are considered as secondary candidates because they touch upon related aspects of the vulnerability. CWE-269 highlights the overarching issue of **improper privilege management**, whereas CWE-250 relates to the **execution with unnecessary privileges**, both of which contribute to the vulnerability's exploitability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
