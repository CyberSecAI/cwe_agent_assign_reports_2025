This commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and would be rejected after job->num_ibs is incremented. In this case, amdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the machine because the ring value is bogus. To fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free() we can do this because the device is actually not used in this function. The next commit will remove the ring argument completely.
