  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdgpu dont access invalid sched Since 2320c9e6a768 (drm/sched memset() job in drm_sched_job_init()) accessing job->base.sched can produce unexpected results as the initialisation of (*job)->base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by the memset. This commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and would be rejected after job->num_ibs is incremented. In this case, amdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the machine because the ring value is bogus. To fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free() we can do this because the device is actually not used in this function. The next commit will remove the ring argument completely. (cherry picked from commit 2ae520cb12831d264ceb97c61f72c59d33c0dbd7)",

CWE-909 is a Class, while CWE-476 is a Base. The description indicates that the `job->base.sched` is being overwritten by `memset` after being initialized in `amdgpu_job_alloc`.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe909\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe909 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing initialization** due to the `memset` overwriting a previously initialized value. This leads to a bogus ring value and ultimately a **NULL pointer dereference**, causing the machine to crash.\n\nMissing Initialization -> NULL Pointer Dereference -> Crash\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, which is the **overwriting of the initialized value**. The fact that the `memset` operation effectively un-initializes the resource led to the selection of CWE-909 as the primary weakness. The crash results from the NULL pointer dereference, so CWE-476 is a secondary concern. The evidence, \"accessing job->base.sched can produce unexpected results as the initialisation of (*job)->base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by the memset,\" directly supports this assessment. The relationship graph shows how the missing initialization can lead to the NULL pointer dereference. CWE-909 is used because the resource is initialized at one point, but then the initialization is lost.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## Technical Explanation for CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n- **How it matches:** The vulnerability description states that the **memset** overwrites the initialization of `job->base.sched`, effectively causing it to be uninitialized at a later point in the code.
