# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-6480
## Query
The SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the no_of_reviews attribute in the woocommerce_reviews shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient input sanitization', 'output escaping on user supplied attributes'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting'
