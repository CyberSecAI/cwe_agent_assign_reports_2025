This vulnerability affects the function gen_rsa_keys of the file common/crypto.py. The manipulation leads to inadequate encryption strength. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1394 CWE-326 CWE-327 CWE-704 CWE-79 CWE-1240 CWE-89 CWE-321",
