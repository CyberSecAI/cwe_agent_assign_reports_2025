  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in calmkart Django-sso-server up to 057247929a94ffc358788a37ab99e391379a4d15. This vulnerability affects the function gen_rsa_keys of the file common/crypto.py. The manipulation leads to **inadequate encryption strength**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states **\"inadequate encryption strength\"**. |\n| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate.

If the **inadequate encryption strength** is due to weak credentials being used. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n- The primary CWE is CWE-326, which is a Class-level CWE.\n- CWE-327 is a peer Class-level CWE that represents a related but distinct weakness. It's about using a broken algorithm, whereas CWE-326 is about using an algorithm that isn't strong enough. If the inadequate strength stems from the choice of a weak algorithm, then CWE-327 might apply.\n- CWE-1391 is a Class-level CWE that describes the use of weak credentials. This could potentially lead to **inadequate encryption strength**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe327 -- PeerOf --> cwe326\n    cwe1391 --> cwe326\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **inadequate encryption strength** (CWE-326) in the `gen_rsa_keys` function. This could be due to a broken or risky algorithm (CWE-327) or the use of weak credentials (CWE-1391). The impact is that the encryption is not strong enough, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"inadequate encryption strength\"**, making CWE-326 the most appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-326 as a potential candidate. The choice is based on the explicit mention of the weakness in the description. CWE-327 and CWE-1391 were considered as possible contributing factors, but without further information, they are classified as secondary candidate CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
