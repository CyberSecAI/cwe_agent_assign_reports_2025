CWE-639 was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the vulnerability where an attacker can modify the FILE_ID to access unauthorized files, which is a specific type of authorization bypass. CWE-863 was considered, but CWE-639 is more precise.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control**, specifically the ability to modify the FILE_ID parameter. This leads to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to files belonging to other users.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) -> Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639) -> Impact: Unauthorized Access to Files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards a general **Improper Access Control** issue. However, after carefully analyzing the vulnerability description and the provided content summary, it became clear that the root cause is more specific: an **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**. The evidence from the vulnerability description indicates that an authenticated attacker can change the FILE_ID parameter to access files belonging to other users. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-639 description.\n\nThe graph relationships also support this decision, as CWE-639 is a child of CWE-284, providing a more specific classification. The retriever results also listed CWE-639 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-639 addressing the specific vulnerability and CWE-284 providing a broader context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
