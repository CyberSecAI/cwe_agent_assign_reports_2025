## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched/fair Fix potential **memory corruption** in child_cfs_rq_on_list child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a prev pointer to a cfs_rq. This prev pointer can originate from struct rqs leaf_cfs_rq_list, making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to **memory corruption**. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and the task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory fault or access garbage data. The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same leaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list. This adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct. This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added to the list, so verifying the prev pointer against the current rqs list head is enough. Fixes a potential **memory corruption** issue that due to current struct layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable behavior when the layout changes.
