The provided fix mentions \"improved input validation,\" directly suggesting CWE-20 as a strong candidate, although it is a Class-level CWE. Other CWEs, such as CWE-787 Out-of-Bounds Write, are considered secondary due to the potential consequence of the **improper input validation**.

The retriever results also listed CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write, which could be a consequence of **improper input validation**.
