  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iio light opt3001 fix deadlock due to concurrent flag access The threaded IRQ function in this driver is reading the flag twice once to lock a mutex and once to unlock it. Even though the code setting the flag is designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could be true at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This results in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock. Fix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading the flag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.",
