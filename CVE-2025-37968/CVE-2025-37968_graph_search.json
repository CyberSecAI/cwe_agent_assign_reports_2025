Even though the code setting the flag is designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could be true at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This results in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock. Fix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading the flag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.
