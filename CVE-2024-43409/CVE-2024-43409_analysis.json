Some endpoints used for member actions lacked proper authentication checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Authentication bypass: The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms intended to protect member-specific actions and data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to member information.\n- Ability to perform member-only actions without proper authorization.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network-based attacks.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- No special privileges or user interaction are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n- An attacker can be remote and does not need prior access.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in Ghost versions >=4.46.0 and <5.89.5\n- The fix is included in version 5.89.5.\n- A workaround is to disable site membership in Ghost settings.\n- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.\n-  The affected endpoints are those used for member actions and reading member information.\n- Specific vulnerable endpoints are not explicitly named in the provided content.\n- The commit dac25612520b571f58679764ecc27109e641d1db addresses the vulnerability by adding uuid verification to member endpoints not requiring a session. This commit also adds a hashed value to endpoints that do not require a member sign in in order to verify the source of the link and resulting request.",

While the vulnerability description mentions \"Improper authentication,\" the more specific CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is more appropriate because the vulnerability lies in the **lack of authentication** on certain endpoints, not an improper implementation of an authentication mechanism. The retriever results also list CWE-306 with good similarity score.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe200 .->|CANFOLLOW| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication** (CWE-306) on specific endpoints, leading to the ability to perform member-only actions and potentially read member information (CWE-200).\n\nCWE-306 (Root Cause) -> CWE-200 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper authentication**, but after reviewing the details and guidance provided, it became clear that the root cause is the **missing authentication** on certain endpoints. This distinction is crucial for selecting the correct CWE. The retriever results and the guidance both point toward the significance of authentication vs. authorization flaws in this specific vulnerability, and the evidence provided supports the selection of CWE-306 as the primary CWE.
