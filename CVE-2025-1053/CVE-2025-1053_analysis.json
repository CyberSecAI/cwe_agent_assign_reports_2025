CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-538 (Information Exposure Through Debug Information). This indicates that the vulnerability involves the unintentional disclosure of sensitive data via logging mechanisms. The secondary CWE is CWE-312, which involves storing sensitive data in cleartext. While there is no direct relationship between CWE-532 and CWE-312, they are conceptually related in that both deal with the exposure of sensitive information. In this case, the encryption key is written to the supportsave file in cleartext, which is a form of storage, albeit temporary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Information Exposure Through Debug Information\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe538,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect writing of the encryption key into a Brocade SANnav supportsave file** under certain error conditions (CWE-532, **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File** and CWE-312, **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**). An attacker with privileged access to the Brocade SANnav database can then obtain the encryption key from the supportsave file. Finally, the attacker can use the encryption key to obtain passwords used by Brocade SANnav.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **writing of the encryption key to the supportsave file**. The evidence for this is clear in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: \"Under certain error conditions during Brocade SANnav installation or upgrade, the encryption key is written into a Brocade SANnav supportsave file.\" This directly supports CWE-532 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**) as the primary weakness. The key is also written in cleartext, which allows us to consider CWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) as an additional weakness.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights that CWE-532 is a specific instance of information exposure, further solidifying its relevance. The retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-532 being a highly ranked candidate. The final decision is based on the evidence provided and the CWE specifications. CWE-532 accurately represents the weakness, and its Base level of abstraction is appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
