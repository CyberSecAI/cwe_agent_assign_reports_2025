This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Samsung SmartThings. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Hub Local API service, which listens on TCP port 8766 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25615. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-620 CWE-288 CWE-290 CWE-287 CWE-291 CWE-321 CWE-285 CWE-347",
