  "description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in the IBL Software Engineering Visual Weather and derived products (NAMIS, Aero Weather, Satellite Weather). The vulnerability is present in the Product Delivery Service (PDS) component in specific server configurations where the PDS pipeline utilizes the IPDS pipeline with Message Editor Output Filters enabled. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send unauthenticated requests to execute the IPDS pipeline with specially crafted Form Properties, enabling remote execution of arbitrary Python code. This vulnerability could lead to a full system compromise of the affected server, particularly if Visual Weather services are run under a privileged user accountcontrary to the documented installation best practices. Upgrade to the patched versions 7.3.10 (or higher), 8.6.0 (or higher).",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly addresses CVE-2025-1077, detailing a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in IBL Software's Visual Weather Product Delivery Service (PDS).\n\n**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered in server configurations where the PDS pipeline utilizes the IPDS pipeline with Message Editor Output Filters enabled. Attackers can craft malicious requests with specific Form Properties.\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to unauthenticated requests to the IPDS pipeline with crafted Form Properties.\n* **Impact of exploitation:**  Full Server Compromise, particularly if Visual Weather services are run under a privileged user account.\n* **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted requests to the PDS pipeline.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No authentication required, attacker needs to be able to send requests to the PDS pipeline endpoint.\n* **Mitigation or fix:**\n    * **Update:** Upgrade to Visual Weather 7.3.10 or higher, or Visual Weather 8.6.0 or higher.\n    * **Temporary Mitigation:**\n        1. Disable PDS pipelines utilizing IPDS pipelines in server configurations.\n        2. Ensure Visual Weather services are not run under a privileged user account.\n        3. Restrict network access to the PDS pipeline endpoint to trusted IP ranges.\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\n*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 High (Base Score) / 7.5 High (Overall)\n*   **Affected Products:** Visual Weather 8.2.5, 7.3.9, 7.3.6 (Enterprise Build), 8.5.2 (Enterprise Build), and derived products (NAMIS, Aero Weather, Satellite Weather) using the same versions.\n*   **Acknowledgment:** The vulnerability was reported by Ianis BERNARD (NCIA).\n\n**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific versions affected, mitigation steps, and CVSS scores.",

While CWE-306 is also relevant due to the **unauthenticated requests**, the ability to execute arbitrary Python code is the more critical and direct consequence of the vulnerability, making CWE-94 the stronger primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe94\n    cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication** (CWE-306) allowing an attacker to send requests. The core issue is the **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94), because the crafted input leads to arbitrary Python code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified both CWE-94 and CWE-306 as relevant. CWE-94 directly addresses the **remote code execution** aspect, which is the most significant impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that an attacker can send **unauthenticated requests to execute the IPDS pipeline with specially crafted Form Properties, enabling remote execution of arbitrary Python code**. The evidence supports selecting CWE-94 as the primary CWE because it explicitly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability: the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code. CWE-306 is a contributing factor, but not the direct cause of the code execution. The graph relationships reinforce that CWE-94 is the more direct and impactful weakness in this scenario.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
