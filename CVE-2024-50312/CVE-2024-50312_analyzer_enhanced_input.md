## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in GraphQL due to **improper access controls** on the GraphQL introspection query. This flaw allows unauthorized users to retrieve a comprehensive list of available queries and mutations. Exposure to this flaw increases the attack surface, as it can facilitate the discovery of flaws or errors specific to the applications GraphQL implementation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access controls**
- **impact:** retrieve comprehensive list of queries and mutations
- **attacker:** unauthorized users
- **product:** GraphQL

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50312:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access controls on the GraphQL introspection query. This allows unauthorized users to access information about all available queries and mutations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the GraphQL schema via introspection, without proper authorization checks. This allows unauthorized users to retrieve a comprehensive list of available queries and mutations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Attack Surface:** By exposing the GraphQL schema, the vulnerability increases the attack surface of the application.
*   **Facilitation of Vulnerability Discovery:** Attackers can leverage the information obtained to identify specific vulnerabilities or processing errors in the application's GraphQL implementation. This enables them to tailor their attacks more effectively.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GraphQL Introspection Query:** The attack vector is the GraphQL introspection query, which is a built-in feature of GraphQL that allows clients to retrieve information about the schema. An attacker can exploit this if there are no access controls in place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the GraphQL endpoint of the vulnerable application.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The vulnerability is due to the absence of access control to the introspection query, implying an attacker need not have legitimate credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content shows the fix for this vulnerability by disabling GQL introspection using `graphql.DisableIntrospection()`.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry provides a description of the vulnerability, its impact and the resolution, it also links to the CVE page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
*   The vulnerability is described as an information leak and is assigned a medium severity and priority.
