I considered CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) and CWE-425 (Forced Browsing) as possible related issues since those are related to Access Control, but the description specifies \"**improper access controls**\" which is more related to assigning wrong privileges rather than bypassing authentication or directly requesting resources without it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe424[\"CWE-424: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard API\"]\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access controls** (CWE-266), leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on **improper access controls**, which aligns directly with CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment). The vulnerability description mentions manipulation leading to this **improper access control**. The evidence is relatively direct but limited, hence the confidence score of 0.7.\n\nCWE-425 and CWE-306 were considered due to their association with access control issues. However, the root cause appears to be specifically about incorrect privilege assignments rather than a complete lack of authentication (CWE-306) or direct request without authorization (CWE-425).\n\nI did not choose other CWEs from the retriever results because they are more about improper neutralization of input, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE

special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of
