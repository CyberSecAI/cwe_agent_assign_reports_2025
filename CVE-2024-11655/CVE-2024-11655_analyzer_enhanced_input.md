## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /admin/network/diag_pinginterface. The manipulation of the argument diag_ping leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of diag_ping argument
- **product:** EnGenius ENH1350EXT and ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT
- **version:** up to 20241118
- **component:** /admin/network/diag_pinginterface

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unfiltered user input being passed directly to a system command in the `diag_ping` functionality of the ENGENIUS router's web interface. Specifically, the value provided by the user for the `diag_ping` parameter is directly used as part of a command executed by the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization or filtering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially gaining complete control of the device. This includes access to system permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the ENGENIUS router, specifically the `/admin/network/diag_ping` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious request that includes shell commands within the `diag_ping` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the router's web interface and be logged in with sufficient privileges to access the diagnostic ping functionality.
