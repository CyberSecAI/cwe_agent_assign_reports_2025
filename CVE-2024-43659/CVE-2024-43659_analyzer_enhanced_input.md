## Vulnerability Description
After gaining access to the firmware of a charging station, a file at can be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model EV chargers. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models. Likelihood Moderate The attacker will first have to abuse a **code execution or file inclusion vulnerability** (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels. Impact Critical All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System Custom page. CVSS clarification Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AVN) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (ACL), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (ATN). The attack is authenticated, and requires high privileges (PRH), there is no user interaction required (UIN). The attack leads to a compromised of the confidentialy of the super user credentials of the device (VCH/VIN/VAN), and can subsequently be used to full compromise and other devices (SCH/SIH/SAH). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (SP). This attack can be automated (AUY).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content and the CVE description placeholder, here's the analysis:

The content from `csirt.divd.nl_897564ae_20250624_122137.html` explicitly redirects to `/cves/CVE-2024-43659/`, indicating a direct relationship to the specified CVE.

The content from `csirt.divd.nl_2ba591ce_20250624_122137.html` redirects to a case number `DIVD-2024-00035/`, which is likely related to the CVE.

The content from `iocharger.com_76dae29e_20250624_122139.html` describes iocharger's EV charging solutions, including OCPP 2.0.1 and ISO15118 PnC certifications. It details products like EV chargers, energy storage systems, and management systems.  It also mentions news items about certifications achieved by iocharger products.

**However, without the actual CVE description, it's impossible to determine if the iocharger information is directly related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-43659.** The information *could* be relevant if the CVE concerns vulnerabilities in OCPP implementations or EV charging infrastructure, but this cannot be confirmed.

Therefore, I will extract the information from the iocharger website as potentially relevant, but with the caveat that its connection to the CVE is currently unknown.

**Potentially Relevant Information (from iocharger.com):**

*   **Products:** Home EV Charger, Commercial EV Charger, DC Fast Charger, Energy Storage System, Charging Station Management System.
*   **Protocols/Standards:** OCPP 1.6J & OCPP 2.0.1, ISO15118 PnC.
*   **Certifications:** CE, UL, German Eichrecht (for IOCAP26 EV Charger), Full OCPP 2.0.1 Certification (first manufacturer to achieve).
*   **Company Focus:** Smart end-to-end energy solutions, reliable hardware & software design.
*   **News:** Recent announcements about achieving OCPP 2.0.1 and Eichrecht certifications.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It details a specific vendor (iocharger) and their products, certifications, and related news.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
