  "description": "Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged operator user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65), there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server. An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `generate msf-stager` command within the Sliver C2 framework. Specifically, the `-out` parameter of `msfvenom` can be injected through the `--advanced` flag, allowing a malicious operator to specify an arbitrary output file path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input to the `msfvenom` command, specifically the filename passed through the `--out` flag within the `--advanced` flag. This allows an attacker to inject their own flags.\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Sliver client before commit `5016fb8` did not strictly validate command-line flags, which was later fixed.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious output file path, a low-privileged operator can overwrite the Sliver server's `go` binary located at `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go` with a payload. When a command executes this binary (like `generate beacon`), it triggers the attacker's payload.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** The RCE occurs as the `root` user on the server since the overwritten `go` binary is executed as root.\n*   **Server Compromise:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain complete control of the Sliver server, giving them access to logs, stored files, operator management, and potentially the ability to delete the server entirely.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely through the Sliver C2's command-and-control interface.\n*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious `generate msf-stager` command that includes the `--advanced` flag with a crafted `--out` flag for `msfvenom`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Operator:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged \"operator\" user within the Sliver C2 framework.\n*   **Slightly Older Client:** The attacker needs to be using a Sliver client prior to commit `5016fb8` which implemented strict command flag validation.\n*   **Multiplayer Mode:** The Sliver server needs to be configured in multiplayer mode with the operator account.\n*  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Sliver server to issue the malicious command.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was introduced in pull request [#1281](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/pull/1281), which added advanced options to the `msf-stager` command.\n*   The exploit demonstrates how a seemingly benign feature (passing arguments to msfvenom) can be leveraged for malicious purposes when input validation is lacking.\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its implications, and how an attacker can leverage it.",

The attacker can control the path. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-88, representing the improper neutralization of argument delimiters. CWE-78 is a parent of CWE-88 and represents the broader category of OS Command Injection, relevant as the injected arguments ultimately lead to OS command execution. CWE-73 is also related because the injected code is written to a file system location controlled by the attacker. The abstraction level of CWE-88 is Base, providing a more specific representation of the vulnerability than its parent class CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe88 -->|CHILDOF| cwe78\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe88\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe88 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper sanitization of user input** passed to the `generate msf-stager` command (CWE-88). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the `msfvenom` command, resulting in **OS command injection** (CWE-78). The injected command writes a file (CWE-73) to a location that results in arbitrary code execution as root. The final impact is **remote code execution** as root, leading to complete server compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly details the **command injection** flaw in the `generate msf-stager` command due to **insufficient input validation**. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-88 as the primary CWE, accurately representing the root cause of the vulnerability. The graph relationships highlight the connection between CWE-88 and its parent class CWE-78, as well as the relationship to CWE-73.\n\nThe selection of CWE-88 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization of argument delimiters** in the command, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. While CWE-78 and CWE-73 are also relevant, they are broader categories that do not fully capture the specific nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not relevant to the vulnerability.
