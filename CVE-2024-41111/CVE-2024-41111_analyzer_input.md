# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41111

## Vulnerability Description
Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged operator user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65), there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server. An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **version:** 1.6.0 (prerelease)
- **component:** teamserver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `generate msf-stager` command within the Sliver C2 framework. Specifically, the `-out` parameter of `msfvenom` can be injected through the `--advanced` flag, allowing a malicious operator to specify an arbitrary output file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input to the `msfvenom` command, specifically the filename passed through the `--out` flag within the `--advanced` flag. This allows an attacker to inject their own flags.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Sliver client before commit `5016fb8` did not strictly validate command-line flags, which was later fixed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious output file path, a low-privileged operator can overwrite the Sliver server's `go` binary located at `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go` with a payload. When a command executes this binary (like `generate beacon`), it triggers the attacker's payload.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The RCE occurs as the `root` user on the server since the overwritten `go` binary is executed as root.
*   **Server Compromise:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain complete control of the Sliver server, giving them access to logs, stored files, operator management, and potentially the ability to delete the server entirely.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely through the Sliver C2's command-and-control interface.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious `generate msf-stager` command that includes the `--advanced` flag with a crafted `--out` flag for `msfvenom`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Operator:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged "operator" user within the Sliver C2 framework.
*   **Slightly Older Client:** The attacker needs to be using a Sliver client prior to commit `5016fb8` which implemented strict command flag validation.
*   **Multiplayer Mode:** The Sliver server needs to be configured in multiplayer mode with the operator account.
*  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Sliver server to issue the malicious command.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in pull request [#1281](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/pull/1281), which added advanced options to the `msf-stager` command.
*   The exploit demonstrates how a seemingly benign feature (passing arguments to msfvenom) can be leveraged for malicious purposes when input validation is lacking.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its implications, and how an attacker can leverage it.
