  "description": "Logsign Unified SecOps Platform **Incorrect Authorization** Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the HTTP API service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of the users license expiration date**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25029.",

The **lack of proper validation of the users license expiration date** (Root Cause).\n2.  **Incorrect Authorization** within the HTTP API service.\n3.  **Authentication Bypass** leads to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **lack of proper validation**, leading to a bypass. The root cause is an **incorrect authorization** (CWE-285) due to the system's failure to properly validate the user's license expiration date. This failure results in an **authentication bypass**. While **missing authentication** (CWE-306) is a contributing factor, the core issue lies in the incorrect authorization process.\n\nI am basing my assessment on the **lack of proper validation of the users license expiration date**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between **improper authorization** and **missing authentication**, and how they both relate to the more general **improper authentication**.\n\nCWE-285 and CWE-306 are chosen because they are at the Base level of abstraction and directly address the **incorrect authorization** and the **lack of proper validation** respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The description mentions that the **implementation** of the authentication algorithm is incorrect.
