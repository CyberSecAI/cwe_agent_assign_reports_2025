  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tipc force a dst refcount before doing decryption As it says in commit 3bc07321ccc2 (xfrm Force a dst refcount before entering the xfrm type handlers) Crypto requests might return asynchronous. In this case we leave the rcu protected region, so force a refcount on the skbs destination entry before we enter the xfrm type input/output handlers. On TIPC decryption path it has the same problem, and skb_dst_force() should be called before doing decryption to avoid a possible crash.
