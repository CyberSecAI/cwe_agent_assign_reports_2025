  "description": "There is a **SQL injection** issue in Esri ArcGIS Monitor versions 2023.0 through 2024.x on Windows and Linux that allows a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to improperly read limited database schema information by passing crafted queries. While it is possible to enumerate some internal database identifiers, the impact to the confidentiality vector is LOW because any sensitive data returned in a response is encrypted. There is no evidence of impact to the integrity or availability vectors. This issue is addressed in ArcGIS Monitor 2024.1.",

It has a parent CWE of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), indicating that SQL injection is a specific type of injection. There are no other relationships that significantly influence the selection, as the description clearly points to an SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **SQL injection** (CWE-89). An authenticated attacker crafts malicious SQL queries, which the application fails to neutralize. This leads to the attacker being able to improperly read limited database schema information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states the presence of a **SQL injection** vulnerability. The key phrase \"allows a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to improperly read limited database schema information by passing crafted queries\" directly indicates the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), which is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). The retriever results also strongly support this classification, with CWE-89 being the top result with a score of 1.0.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n\nCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n\n**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n- **weakness:** **SQL injection**\n\nThe vulnerability description mentions a **SQL injection** issue, making CWE-89 the most accurate classification.",
