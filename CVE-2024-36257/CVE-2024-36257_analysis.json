CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization is a broader Class-level CWE that describes the general authorization failure.

This leads to the impact of a malicious remote server being able to change profile images of users on another remote server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily due to an **authorization bypass** where the application **fails to properly authorize** the request to update a user's profile picture, allowing a malicious remote server to modify profile images of users belonging to another server. This aligns well with CWE-639, which describes an authorization bypass through a user-controlled key. The \"remote server A\" requesting the update acts as the \"user-controlled key\" that is not properly validated.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is strong, based on the vulnerability description which states the application **fails to check** that the remote server A requesting the server B to update the profile picture of a user is the remote that actually has the user as a local one. This **failure to check** directly relates to an authorization issue.\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a broader category that could apply, but CWE-639 is more specific because it highlights the user-controlled key aspect of the authorization bypass. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, could also apply, as there's a **failure to authenticate** the remote server's identity. However, the core issue is the authorization bypass using the remote server ID, making CWE-639 the most accurate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data. In this case, the \"key value\" is the remote server ID, which is not properly validated.\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This is a more general description of the authorization failure.\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources. There's a **failure to authenticate** the remote server's identity before processing the profile picture update request.",
