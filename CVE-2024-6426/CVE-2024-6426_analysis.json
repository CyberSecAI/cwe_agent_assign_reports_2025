CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, and while more specific base-level CWEs might exist, the provided information doesn't give enough details to pinpoint the exact authorization flaw. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and a peer of CWE-863, representing a potential outcome of authorization issues. Choosing CWE-863 is preferred as it focuses on the **incorrect authorization** mechanism, which directly aligns with the **root cause** described. The relationship to CWE-200 helped identify the potential impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) and access to different resources. The local attacker's ability to change the API value of the application is the vector used to exploit the flawed authorization mechanism.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based on the vulnerability description indicating an **information exposure vulnerability** where a local attacker can access different resources by changing the API value. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights that the root cause is **information exposure due to insufficient access controls.**\n\nThe retriever results suggest several CWEs. CWE-200 is a potential candidate, but it describes the impact rather than the root cause. Other CWEs like CWE-668, CWE-284, and CWE-287 are too generic or don't fit the specifics of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" is the most appropriate because it addresses the flawed authorization check that allows unauthorized access. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the ability to access different resources by manipulating the API, indicating a problem with how authorization is handled. While a more specific Base-level CWE might exist, the current description lacks the necessary details to pinpoint the exact authorization flaw.\n\nTherefore, CWE-863 is the primary CWE, representing the root cause, and CWE-200 is a secondary CWE, representing a possible impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
