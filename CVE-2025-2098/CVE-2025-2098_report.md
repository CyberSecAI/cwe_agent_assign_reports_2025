# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-2098

## Description

Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with **incorrect file permissions** (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for **Dylib Hijacking**. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects Fast CAD Reader in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** incorrect file permissions
- **Weakness:** Dylib Hijacking
- **Impact:** privilege escalation
- **Product:** Fast CAD Reader application
- **Version:** possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages, tested version 4.1.5

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The application was installed with **incorrect file permissions**. |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. |
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. This vulnerability allows for **Dylib Hijacking**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-732, which is a Class-level weakness related to incorrect permission assignments. This is supported by the description stating the application was installed with incorrect file permissions. CWE-266 is a Base-level weakness related to incorrect privilege assignment. It is considered due to the potential for privilege escalation. CWE-427 is a Base-level weakness related to uncontrolled search path elements. It is considered due to the possibility of Dylib Hijacking.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect file permissions** (CWE-732), leading to a **Dylib Hijacking** vulnerability (CWE-427), and ultimately resulting in privilege escalation (CWE-266).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-732 as the primary weakness due to the **incorrect file permissions** being the root cause. The supporting evidence from the vulnerability description clearly states that "Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with **incorrect file permissions** (rwxrwxrwx)." The retriever results also list CWE-732 as the top combined result. The guidance on privileges vs. permissions also suggests that when dealing with assignment of permissions for resources, CWE-732 is a good fit.

CWE-266 and CWE-427 are secondary candidates because the **incorrect file permissions** can lead to privilege escalation and **Dylib Hijacking**, respectively. These are consequences of the root cause.

CWE-732 is selected at the Class level because it directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment**. While more specific variants might exist, the provided information does not offer enough details to narrow down the selection further. CWE-266 and CWE-427 are selected because they are at the Base level of abstraction which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
