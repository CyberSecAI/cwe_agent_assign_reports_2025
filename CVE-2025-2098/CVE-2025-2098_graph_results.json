  "query": "Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with incorrect file permissions (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for Dylib Hijacking. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects Fast CAD Reader in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5",
