# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2098

## Vulnerability Description
Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with **incorrect file permissions** (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for **Dylib Hijacking**. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects Fast CAD Reader in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect file permissions**
- **weakness:** **Dylib Hijacking**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **product:** Fast CAD Reader application
- **version:** possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages, tested version 4.1.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2098 based on provided content:

**1. Verification:**

The content from cert.pl directly addresses CVE-2025-2098, detailing a vulnerability in the Fast CAD Reader application. This confirms relevance.

**2. Extracted Information:**

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect file permissions (rwxrwxrwx) assigned to the Fast CAD Reader application on macOS, deviating from standard macOS security practices (drwxr-xr-x).
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).  This allows for Dylib Hijacking.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation. Guest accounts, other users, and applications can exploit the vulnerability.
* **Attack vectors:** Dylib Hijacking.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with access to the system (even a guest account) can exploit the vulnerability.
* **Mitigation or fix:** The report does not specify a fix, but implies that correcting the file permissions to standard macOS settings would mitigate the vulnerability. The vendor has not responded to messages regarding the issue.
* **Vulnerable versions:** All versions through 4.1.5.
* **Report source:** Report to CERT Polska.

**3. Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It specifies the CWE, explains the root cause, details the impact, and identifies the attack vector. It also provides information about the reporting process and the lack of vendor response.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
