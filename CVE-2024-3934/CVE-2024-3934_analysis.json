  "description": "The Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Path Traversal** in versions 7.3.0 to 7.5.1 via the mercadopagoDownloadLog function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to download and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. The arbitrary file download was patched in 7.5.1, while the **missing authorization** was corrected in version 7.6.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3934:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the `mercadopagoDownloadLog` function of the Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce plugin. Specifically, the plugin did not properly validate the filename provided by the user, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Path Traversal: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when processing the filename for log download. The plugin directly uses the provided filename to construct a file path.\n- Insufficient Authorization: Although not the primary issue for this CVE, the vulnerability could be exploited by any authenticated user with subscriber-level access or higher.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary File Download: A successful exploit allows an attacker to download and read the contents of any file on the server that the webserver has access to.\n- Sensitive Information Disclosure: This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including configuration files, database credentials, and other potentially confidential data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- HTTP Request: The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the `mercadopagoDownloadLog` function with a manipulated filename parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Authenticated User: The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.\n- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious request.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable code was located in `src/IO/Downloader.php` within the plugin.\n- The `mercadopagoDownloadLog` function in `src/Admin/Settings.php` triggers the download functionality.\n- The vulnerability was patched by adding filename validation in version 7.5.1 and missing authorization was corrected in version 7.6.2.\n- The fix involves a `validateFilename` method to check for disallowed characters, extensions, and expected terms in the filename.\n- The initial fix in version 7.5.1 introduced a filename validation method.\n- Further changes in version 7.6.2 added a `validatesDownloadSecurity` method to check both the filename and the user permissions before allowing the download.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof Zaj\u0105c from CERT PL.\n- The Wordfence article also provides references to the specific code changesets in the WordPress plugin's repository.\n- The vulnerability was rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.5.",
