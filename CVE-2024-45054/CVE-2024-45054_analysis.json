  "description": "Hwameistor is an HA local storage system for cloud-native stateful workloads. This ClusterRole has * verbs of * resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has hwameistors deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation. This issue has been patched in version 0.14.6. All users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should update and limit the ClusterRole using security-role.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The `hwameistor-role` ClusterRole in the `hwameistor` project was granted overly permissive permissions, specifically `*` verbs on `*` resources. This violates the principle of least privilege and created a potential security risk.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Excessive Permissions:** The `hwameistor-role` ClusterRole had broad, unrestricted permissions, allowing any service account associated with it to perform any action on any resource within the cluster.\n- **Shared Service Account:** The `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` used a shared service account instead of a dedicated one, inheriting these excessive permissions.\n- **Unnecessary Permissions:** The `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` had permissions it didn't actually require, such as the ability to create/update/delete deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, cronjobs, replicasets, jobs, and read all secrets.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Cluster-Level Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gaining access to the service account token associated with the `hwameistor-role` could exploit the excessive permissions to perform any action on any resource in the cluster, effectively taking over the entire cluster.\n- **Data Leakage:** The attacker could list and steal all secrets in the cluster, potentially exposing sensitive information like database passwords, cloud credentials, and even cluster admin tokens.\n- **Malicious Container Deployment:** The attacker could create privileged containers, possibly escaping to the host and gaining root access on worker nodes.\n- **Node Manipulation:** The attacker could patch nodes, potentially tainting them or hijacking pods with high RBAC permissions.\n- **Full Cluster Compromise:** Combination of the above could allow an attacker to completely take over the cluster, including control over master nodes.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Compromised Worker Node:** An attacker controlling a single worker node could exploit the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` DaemonSet running on that node to gain access to its service account token and escalate privileges to the entire cluster.\n- **Supply Chain Attack:** A compromised build environment or injected malicious code could exfiltrate the service account token.\n- **RCE Vulnerability:** Remote code execution vulnerabilities in any application that can read local files on a pod/node could be used to obtain the service account token.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Access to Service Account Token:** The attacker needs to obtain the token of the service account associated with the vulnerable ClusterRole. This could be achieved by controlling a node where `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` runs, exploiting an RCE, or a supply chain compromise.\n- **Basic Knowledge of Kubernetes:** The attacker needs a general understanding of how Kubernetes works to utilize the permissions, create resources like pods, and extract information using `kubectl`.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability was reported by multiple sources: HouqiyuA, Yseona, sparkEchooo, and younaman.\n- The fix was implemented in commit `edf4cebed73cadd230bf97eab65c5311f2858450` and subsequently released in version v0.14.6. This commit limited the RBAC permissions of the `hwameistor-role`.\n- The provided content references issue #1460 and #1457, both related to this vulnerability and its discovery.\n- The issue was addressed by limiting the permissions granted to the `hwameistor-role`, following the principle of least privilege.\n\nThis information is much more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.",
