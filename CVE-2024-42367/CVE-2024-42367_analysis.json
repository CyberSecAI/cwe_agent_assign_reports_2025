  "description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to **path traversal** outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from **path traversal** outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default). It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file. Version 3.10.2 contains a patch for the issue.",

CWE-22 is a broader category describing path traversal issues. CWE-59 can lead to CWE-22 if the link resolves to a location outside the intended directory. Thus, the relationship is that CWE-59 can precede CWE-22. CWE-59 is more specific and better captures the root cause. The base abstraction level is appropriate for both.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe59 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of symbolic links** (CWE-59). This allows an attacker to bypass path traversal protection mechanisms, ultimately leading to the ability to access files outside the intended static file directory (**path traversal**, CWE-22), potentially resulting in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-59, **Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the server **does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-59. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"Incorrect symlink handling\" as a vulnerability. The **path traversal** (CWE-22) occurs because of the failure to properly handle the symbolic link, making CWE-59 the root cause.\n\nCWE-22, **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, was considered as a secondary weakness. The vulnerability allows for reading files outside the intended directory, which aligns with the description of CWE-22. However, it's a consequence of the **improper link resolution**, not the primary cause.\n\nThe selection is based on the vulnerability description, which states the server **fails to check symbolic links** when serving static files. The retriever results also list CWE-59 and CWE-22 as highly relevant, further supporting the classification. The base abstraction level is chosen for both CWEs because it accurately represents the specific weaknesses without being overly generic or overly specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
