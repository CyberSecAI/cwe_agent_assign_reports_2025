  "description": "spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. **Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation** can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected. If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible for the returned permission to be no permission when permission is expected. Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.35.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use caveats or avoid the use of caveats on an indirect subject type with multiple entries.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46989:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability arises from how SpiceDB handles multiple caveats applied to the same indirect subject type within a relation. When a resource has multiple relations to a subject type, and each relation is associated with a caveat, the permission check logic can incorrectly return \"no permission\" even when permission should be granted based on the individual caveats.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Incorrect handling of multiple caveats on the same indirect subject type within a relation.\n- Failure to properly aggregate or evaluate caveats when multiple paths to the subject exist.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- The primary impact is an incorrect permission check result. Specifically, the `CheckPermission` API may return `NO_PERMISSION` when the intended result should be `PERMISSION` or `CAVEATED_MEMBER`. This can lead to users being denied access to resources they should have access to.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n- The attack complexity is considered high (`AC:H`), indicating that the conditions for exploitation may be somewhat specific.\n- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability (`PR:N`).\n- No user interaction is required (`UI:N`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, but must be able to make requests over the network to the service.\n- The attacker must understand the schema, caveats and relations to configure the necessary relations and resources to trigger the flawed logic.\n- The attacker must be able to define multiple relations with caveats to the same indirect subject type.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in versions of SpiceDB prior to 1.35.3.\n- The fix is included in version 1.35.3.\n- The vulnerability is rated as low severity (3.7) due to the limited impact. The confidentiality and availability impacts are none, and the integrity impact is low.\n- The provided code diff in the first document shows the changes made to correct the behaviour, and introduces new test cases.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nGiven the following schema:\n\n```\ndefinition user {}\n\ncaveat somecaveat(somefield int) {\n  somefield == 42\n}\n\ndefinition group {\n  relation member: user\n}\n\ndefinition resource {\n  relation viewer: group#member with somecaveat\n  permission view = viewer\n}\n```\n\nIf a resource has multiple groups associated with it, each with a different caveat, it might incorrectly return \"no permission\" for a user who satisfies at least one of the caveats.",

The vulnerability description highlights that the system's authorization mechanism fails to properly evaluate multiple caveats, leading to incorrect permission results. While CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, it encapsulates the core issue of flawed authorization logic. No child CWEs of CWE-863 provide a more precise description of the vulnerability. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), were deemed less suitable. CWE-862 doesn't apply because the system *does* perform authorization checks, albeit incorrectly. CWE-285 is a more generic Improper Authorization. CWE-863 is also related to CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) through a ChildOf relationship, but CWE-942 is not applicable here as cross-domain policies are irrelevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect handling of multiple caveats** on the same indirect subject type and relation.

The chain is direct:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Caveats (CWE-863)**\n2.

However, based on a closer examination of the vulnerability description and the guidance provided, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability involves an existing authorization mechanism that fails to handle multiple caveats correctly, leading to an incorrect permission being returned.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is derived from the following vulnerability description snippets:\n\n*   \"**Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation** can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected.\"\n*   \"Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API.\"\n\nThis demonstrates that an authorization check exists, but it's implemented incorrectly, aligning perfectly with CWE-863.\n\nThe retriever results also ranked CWE-863 as the top candidate.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): Not applicable because authorization checks *are* performed, but they are flawed.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): A more generic authorization failure, but CWE-863 is more specific.\n*   CWE-201, CWE-212, CWE-226, CWE-256, CWE-281, CWE-367, CWE-732: These CWEs are not related to authorization, and so were not considered.\n\nThe decision to classify this vulnerability as CWE-863 is based on the evidence that the authorization logic is present but **incorrect**, leading to the wrong permissions being granted.
