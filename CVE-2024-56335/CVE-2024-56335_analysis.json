  "description": "vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. In affected versions an attacker is capable of updating or deleting groups from an organization given a few conditions 1. The attacker has a user account in the server. 2. The attackers account has admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization. 3. The attacker knows the target organizations UUID and the target groups UUID. Note that this vulnerability is related to group functionality and as such is only applicable for servers who have enabled the `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED` setting, which is disabled by default. This attack can lead to different situations 1. Denial of service, the attacker can limit users from accessing the organizations data by removing their membership from the group. 2. Privilege escalation, if the attacker is part of the victim organization, they can escalate their own privileges by joining a group they wouldnt normally have access to. For attackers that arent part of the organization, this shouldnt lead to any possible plain-text data exfiltration as all the data is encrypted client side. This vulnerability is patched in Vaultwarden `1.32.7`, and users are recommended to update as soon as possible. If its not possible to update to `1.32.7`, some possible workarounds are 1. Disabling `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED`, which would disable groups functionality on the server. 2. Disabling `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`, which would not allow an attacker to create new accounts on the server.",

The analysis considered whether a more specific base CWE like CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) or CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) would be a better fit, but ultimately decided that CWE-863 best captures the **incorrect authorization** mechanism at play. The Retriever Results also played a role, where CWE-863 had the highest similarity score.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), which allows an attacker with privileges in one organization to modify groups in another organization. This leads to privilege escalation or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE summary point to an **incorrect authorization** mechanism that allows unauthorized actions. The Retriever Results also support this assessment, with CWE-863 having the highest similarity score. While the attacker needs specific knowledge (organization and group UUIDs) to exploit the vulnerability, the core issue is the **incorrect authorization** logic that does not properly isolate organizations. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 providing a general classification of the authorization issue, and CWE-266 as a secondary candidate providing more specific details of **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
