  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Tenda AC7 up to 15.03.06.44. This affects the function formSetFirewallCfg of the file /goform/SetFirewallCfg. The manipulation of the argument firewallEn leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
