Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP/2 to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle WebLogic Server.

CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which is a more general case. However, the description specifically mentions an unauthenticated attacker, making CWE-306 a more accurate fit. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a potential result of the **missing authentication**, as an attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by exhausting server resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) which allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit the system. This leads to a denial-of-service condition, potentially through **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states that an **unauthenticated attacker** can cause a denial-of-service. Therefore, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results listed CWE-306 with a reasonable score, further supporting this choice.
