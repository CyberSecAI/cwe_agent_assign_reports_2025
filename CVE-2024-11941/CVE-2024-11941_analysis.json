CWE-770 has a parent-child relationship with CWE-400 \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\". CWE-789 \"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\" is a child of CWE-770. The choice of CWE-770 is based on the vulnerability description referring to \"Excessive Allocation\", which aligns with the concept of allocating resources without limits.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation (CWE-770), leading to **excessive allocation**, and ultimately causing **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the \"Excessive Allocation\" mentioned in the vulnerability description. The primary candidate was CWE-770 \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\", which directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The choice of CWE-770 is also influenced by the retriever results, where it shows up with a good score. The final selection of CWE-770 is based on its direct relevance to the **root cause** of the vulnerability, as it represents the **lack of limits** on resource allocation that leads to the excessive allocation issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of
