  "description": "The Small Package Quotes For Customers of FedEx plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the edit_id and dropship_edit_id parameters in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is a more general class of weakness, and while applicable, CWE-89 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

While **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** can be considered forms of improper input validation, CWE-89 directly addresses the specific context of SQL injection. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CWE-89, and its base level abstraction provides the optimal level of specificity for this vulnerability.
