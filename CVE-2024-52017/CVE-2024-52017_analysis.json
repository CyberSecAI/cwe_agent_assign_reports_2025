The **stack overflow** occurs due to **improper** handling of the `passphrase` parameter. |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Stack overflow leads to writing beyond the allocated buffer. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.4 | Class | Allowed | A more general class of error. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).

The root cause is the **improper** handling of the passphrase parameter.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **stack overflow** in the Netgear XR300 router due to **improper** handling of the `passphrase` parameter in the `bridge_wireless_main.cgi` script. This directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The crafted POST request overwrites data on the stack, leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe provided evidence includes the key phrase \"stack overflow\" and mentions the vulnerable component and parameter. The description aligns well with the definition of CWE-121. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a related CWE, as the stack overflow results in writing beyond the allocated buffer. I considered CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input), but CWE-121 is more specific as it explicitly mentions a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-121 as the top match. Other CWEs like CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) were considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow rather than a command injection issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The mapping guidance for CWE-121 allows its usage.",
