## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3345 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability report, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'id=3&del=' parameter in the '/admin/combo.php' file.  Malicious code is injected directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The '/admin/combo.php' file is vulnerable via the 'id=3&del=' parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the '/admin/combo.php' endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples (from the content):**

*   `id=3' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (7021=7021) THEN 3 ELSE 0x28 END))-- mxto&del=`
*   `id=3' AND 2650=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x63534151))-- GdUs&del=`

The content also includes a command line example using `sqlmap` to test for the vulnerability and retrieve database information.
