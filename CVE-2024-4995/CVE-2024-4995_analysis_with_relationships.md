## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-757, which describes the vulnerability where a less secure algorithm is negotiated. CWE-319 is a consequence of this vulnerability, where sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext. CWE-757 is a base level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. CWE-319 is also a base level CWE, specifying what happens when the algorithm is downgraded.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the server requesting a downgrade to a less secure algorithm, leading to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.

Root Cause: CWE-757 Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
Impact: CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the application is **vulnerable to MS SQL protocol downgrade request**. The **root cause** is the **lack of encryption** and accepting the downgrade request. This leads to unencrypted communication, which is a direct consequence of the downgrade.

The retriever results also highlight CWE-757 as a strong candidate. CWE-319 is also a good match, as it describes the consequence of the vulnerability.

CWE-757 is at the base level of abstraction and accurately represents the vulnerability, so it is a good level of specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

**CWE-311** was considered but not selected because it is a class level CWE and there are more specific children available like **CWE-319** which more directly describes the vulnerability.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**CWE-303** was considered but not selected because the authentication algorithm is not implemented incorrectly.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**CWE-1391** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to weak credentials.

## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**CWE-757** was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is due to the selection of a less secure algorithm. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application is **vulnerable to MS SQL protocol downgrade request**.

## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**CWE-326** was considered but not selected because the encryption scheme is not weak. The vulnerability is due to the selection of a less secure algorithm.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**CWE-346** was considered but not selected because the origin validation is not the rootcause of the vulnerability.

## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**CWE-602** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to client-side enforcement of server-side security.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**CWE-294** was considered but not selected because the authentication bypass is not by capture-replay.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**CWE-807** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not due to reliance on untrusted inputs.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**CWE-319** was selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. The impact section describes the impact as "unencrypted communication vulnerable to data interception and modification"
