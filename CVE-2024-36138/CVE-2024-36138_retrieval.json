(according to netapp advisory)\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- Malicious command line arguments.\\n- Exploitation occurs through `child_process.spawn` and `child_process.spawnSync` on Windows.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- Ability to pass malicious command-line arguments to Node.js applications using `child_process.spawn` or `child_process.spawnSync` on Windows.\\n- No shell option needs to be enabled for exploitation.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The vulnerability is rated as High severity.\\n- The vulnerability affects all active Node.js release lines: 22.x, 20.x, and 18.x.\\n- NetApp identifies the CVSS score as 10.0 (CRITICAL) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus':
