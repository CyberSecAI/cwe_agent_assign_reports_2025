# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36138

# Vulnerability Description

    Bypass **incomplete fix** of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from **improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows** via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync. A malicious command line argument can inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled.
