# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38374

## Vulnerability Description
The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to **XML External Entity (XXE)** injection. This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **The DocumentBuilderFactory used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely**
- **weakness:** **XML External Entity (XXE)**
- **product:** _cyclonedx-core-java_
- **version:** before 9.0.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-38374:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `cyclonedx-core-java` library used an insecurely configured `DocumentBuilderFactory` when parsing XML files to determine the schema version of CycloneDX Bill of Materials (BOM).
- The library uses XPath expressions to identify the schema version, which was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection because external DTDs and schemas were not disabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **XXE Injection:** The library was susceptible to XXE injection due to the improper configuration of the `DocumentBuilderFactory`, which allowed external entities to be resolved.
- The `DocumentBuilderFactory` was not configured to disable external DTDs and schemas, allowing an attacker to include malicious external entities within an XML BOM.
- Specifically, the code did not set `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to empty strings, which would have prevented external DTDs and schemas from being accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Local File Content Exfiltration:** An attacker could use XXE to read sensitive local files from the server where the vulnerable application was running.
- **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could use XXE to force the server to make requests to other internal services, potentially revealing information or compromising adjacent infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is **network** based, meaning that an attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted malicious XML file over the network.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the XML file to determine the schema version.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to supply the vulnerable application with a malicious XML file.
- No privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.0.4 of the `cyclonedx-core-java` library.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit `162aa59`.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #434 and commit `ab0bc9c`, which includes the following changes:
    - Setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to "" on the DocumentBuilderFactory to prevent external entities from being accessed.
    - Removal of the XPath-based namespace extraction in favor of an approach that parses the XML to find the namespace declarations.
- A proof of concept (PoC) was provided, demonstrating how an attacker could use an external DTD to trigger a connection to a specified URL.
-  The CVSS v3 score is 7.5 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`

This provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it was addressed.
