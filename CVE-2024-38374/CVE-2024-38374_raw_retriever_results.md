# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38374

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38374
## Query
The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'The DocumentBuilderFactory used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely'
- **weakness**: 'XML External Entity (XXE)'
