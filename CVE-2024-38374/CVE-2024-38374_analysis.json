  "description": "The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to **XML External Entity (XXE)** injection. This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-38374:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The `cyclonedx-core-java` library used an insecurely configured `DocumentBuilderFactory` when parsing XML files to determine the schema version of CycloneDX Bill of Materials (BOM).\n- The library uses XPath expressions to identify the schema version, which was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection because external DTDs and schemas were not disabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **XXE Injection:** The library was susceptible to XXE injection due to the improper configuration of the `DocumentBuilderFactory`, which allowed external entities to be resolved.\n- The `DocumentBuilderFactory` was not configured to disable external DTDs and schemas, allowing an attacker to include malicious external entities within an XML BOM.\n- Specifically, the code did not set `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to empty strings, which would have prevented external DTDs and schemas from being accessed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Local File Content Exfiltration:** An attacker could use XXE to read sensitive local files from the server where the vulnerable application was running.\n- **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could use XXE to force the server to make requests to other internal services, potentially revealing information or compromising adjacent infrastructure.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- The attack vector is **network** based, meaning that an attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted malicious XML file over the network.\n- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the XML file to determine the schema version.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs the ability to supply the vulnerable application with a malicious XML file.\n- No privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.\n- The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.0.4 of the `cyclonedx-core-java` library.\n- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit `162aa59`.\n- The fix was implemented in pull request #434 and commit `ab0bc9c`, which includes the following changes:\n    - Setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to \"\" on the DocumentBuilderFactory to prevent external entities from being accessed.\n    - Removal of the XPath-based namespace extraction in favor of an approach that parses the XML to find the namespace declarations.\n- A proof of concept (PoC) was provided, demonstrating how an attacker could use an external DTD to trigger a connection to a specified URL.\n-  The CVSS v3 score is 7.5 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`\n\nThis provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it was addressed.",
