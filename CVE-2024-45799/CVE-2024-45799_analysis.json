  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-45799",
  "description": "FluxCP is a web-based Control Panel for rAthena servers written in PHP. A **javascript injection** is possible via venders/buyers list pages and shop names, that are currently not sanitized. This allows executing arbitrary javascript code on the users browser just by visiting the shop pages. As a result all logged in to fluxcp users can have their session info stolen. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of shop names displayed on the vendors/buyers list pages within the FluxCP application. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of input sanitization, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users visiting the affected shop pages. The provided content specifically mentions the potential for session information theft.\n\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript within shop names. This malicious data is then displayed on the vendors/buyers list pages, triggering the code execution when a user visits those pages.\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate shop names to inject malicious JavaScript. This would likely involve either creating a shop or somehow modifying existing shop data. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the server itself, but rather the ability to interact with the application in ways that affect data being displayed.\n\nThe provided content gives more information than the placeholder CVE description, detailing the attack vector and impact.",

The application **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. There are child CWEs of CWE-79, but the description doesn't indicate a need to go into that level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input sanitization**, leading to **JavaScript injection**, and culminating in **session info theft**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a cross-site scripting vulnerability due to **lack of input sanitization**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the absence of sanitization on shop names, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. This aligns directly with the characteristics of CWE-79. The Retriever results also supports this assessment, ranking CWE-79 as the most relevant.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-79 is based on its direct applicability to the vulnerability description and its Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Why it was not selected:** CWE-80 is a variant of XSS that focuses on script-related HTML tags.
