CWE-425 is a child of CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). This indicates that the **Direct Request** vulnerability occurs due to missing or inadequate authorization checks. CWE-497 can be an impact of CWE-425 when sensitive information is exposed due to the missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe497\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe288,cwe862 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (**CWE-425**) for accessing the \"Browsing History Handler\" component, which leads to the **information disclosure** (**CWE-497**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of proper authorization** when accessing the browsing history. The key phrase \"Browsing History Handler\" and the fact that the manipulation leads to \"information disclosure\" are indicators. The component can be accessed directly without proper checks, leading to **information disclosure**.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) is the most appropriate because the vulnerability description states the manipulation leads to information disclosure via the file `/user/home?userId=1&homeSelectType=read` of the component Browsing History Handler. This suggests that the application does not adequately enforce authorization, allowing direct access to restricted resources.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is considered as a secondary weakness, as the ultimate impact of the missing authorization is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): This CWE is related to XSS vulnerabilities, which are not directly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): This CWE is related to SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are not directly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs): This CWE is related to logging vulnerabilities, which are not directly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements): This is a class level CWE and not as specific as CWE-425.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
