  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb cdns3 Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget The cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit 58f2fcb3a845 (usb cdnsp Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget). Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using iperf --bidir over NCM ethernet link. The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.",
