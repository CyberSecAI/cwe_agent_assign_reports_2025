Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using iperf --bidir over NCM ethernet link. The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-413 CWE-367 CWE-121 CWE-401 CWE-667 CWE-364 CWE-1331 CWE-663 CWE-833",
