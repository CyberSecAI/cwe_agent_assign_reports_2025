# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-56321
## Query
GoCD is a continuous deliver server. GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive) can allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration post-backup script feature to potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCDs user, rather than pre-configured scripts. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server. No known workarounds are available.
