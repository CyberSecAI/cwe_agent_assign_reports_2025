  "query": "The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This is due to improper configurations in the jobsearch_xing_response_data_callback, set_access_tokes, and google_callback functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Xing user, or any connected Xing user if the Xing id is known. It is also possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Google user if the user has logged in, without subsequently logging out, in thirty days. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.4.",
