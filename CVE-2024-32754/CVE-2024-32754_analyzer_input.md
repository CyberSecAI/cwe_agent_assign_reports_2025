# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-32754

## Vulnerability Description
Under certain circumstances, when the controller is in factory reset mode waiting for initial setup, it will broadcast its MAC address, serial number, and firmware version. Once configured, the controller will no longer broadcast this information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** and firmware version and broadcast MAC address and factory reset and serial number
- **product:** controller

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-32754:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from cisa.gov directly references CVE-2024-32754 and provides specific details about the vulnerability. The Johnson Controls document also acknowledges the issue with a reference to JCI-PSA-2024-13, which aligns with the CISA advisory. Therefore, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Kantech door controllers broadcasting sensitive information (MAC address, serial number, and firmware version) when in factory reset mode and waiting for initial setup.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200):** The controllers broadcast sensitive information while in factory reset mode.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information about the affected door controller.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Adjacent Network:** The information is broadcast over the adjacent network.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  An attacker needs to be on the adjacent network to intercept the broadcasted information.
    *  The vulnerability is present only when the controller is in factory reset mode, waiting for its initial setup.
    *   The attack complexity is high.
    *   Exploitation is not possible remotely.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Kantech KT1 Door Controller, Rev01: Versions 2.09.01 and prior
    *   Kantech KT2 Door Controller, Rev01: Versions 2.09.01 and prior
    *   Kantech KT400 Door Controller, Rev01: Versions 3.01.16 and prior
*   **Mitigation:** Johnson Controls recommends updating the affected controllers to the following versions (or later):
    *   Kantech KT1 Door Controller: Version 3.10.12
    *   Kantech KT2 Door Controller: Version 3.10.12
    *   Kantech KT400 Door Controller: Version 3.03
*   **CISA Recommendations:**
    *   Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
    *   Locate control system networks behind firewalls, isolated from business networks.
    *   Use VPNs for remote access, with awareness that VPNs need to be up to date and properly secured.
*   **No known public exploitation** has been reported to CISA at this time.

**4. Summary of Extracted Information:**

The vulnerability (CVE-2024-32754) is caused by Kantech door controllers broadcasting sensitive information when in factory reset mode. This exposure could enable an attacker on the same network to learn details about the device. The CISA advisory and Johnson Controls document recommend updating the firmware to specific versions to remediate this vulnerability.
