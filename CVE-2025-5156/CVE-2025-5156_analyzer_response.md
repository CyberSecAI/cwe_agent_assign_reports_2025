# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-5156

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves a buffer overflow on the stack. |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. A more general case of buffer overflows. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, which is a variant of the more general CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow** and **stack overflow**, thus justifying the selection of CWE-121 as the primary cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the manipulation of the 'param' argument in the EditWlanMacList function, leading to a **buffer overflow** on the stack. This allows an attacker to potentially overwrite memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that manipulating the argument "param" leads to a **buffer overflow** in the EditWlanMacList function, affecting the H3C GR-5400AX router. The vulnerability is located on the stack, making CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class that encompasses buffer overflows, but CWE-121 is more specific and accurate given the stack location.

The retriever results also list CWE-121 with a high score, further supporting this decision. The mapping guidance for CWE-121 allows its usage, while CWE-119 is discouraged, because more specific CWEs should be considered.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input): While this could be relevant, the description does not explicitly mention a buffer copy operation.
*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): Not relevant as the issue is not related to integer overflows.
*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): Not relevant as the issue is not related to SQL injection.
*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not relevant as the issue is not related to XSS.
*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): The vulnerability is a write, not a read.
*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')): Not relevant as the issue is not related to OS command injection.
