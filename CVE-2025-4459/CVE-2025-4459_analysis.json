  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Patient Record Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file fecalysis_form.php. The manipulation of the argument itr_no leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
