  "description": "GPT Academy version 3.83 in the binary-husky/gpt_academic repository is vulnerable to **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking** (CSWSH). This vulnerability allows an attacker to hijack an existing WebSocket connection between the victims browser and the server, enabling unauthorized actions such as deleting conversation history without the victims consent. The issue arises due to **insufficient WebSocket authentication and lack of origin validation**.",

The primary weakness is **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking**.\n\nCWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets) is a strong match because the description explicitly mentions \"lack of origin validation\".

This is a variant level CWE, making it more specific.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a possible secondary weakness because the description mentions \"**insufficient WebSocket authentication**\". If authentication is completely missing, then this CWE is appropriate.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1385 is based on the explicit mention of \"origin validation\" and its higher specificity as a variant. If origin validation was present, but flawed, then CWE-346 would be more appropriate.
