## Vulnerability Description
biscuit-rust is the Rust implementation of Biscuit, an authentication and authorization token for microservices architectures. Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a ThirdPartyBlock request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it, which includes the public key of the previous block (used in the signature) and the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **generating Third-party blocks without transferring the whole token**
- **impact:** generate datalog trusting the wrong keypair
- **vector:** ThirdPartyBlock request forgery
- **attacker:** malicious user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how third-party blocks are generated in the biscuit-auth library. A malicious user can manipulate the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` by altering the `publicKeys` field. This allows them to trick the third-party authority into generating a datalog rule that trusts a different keypair than intended, effectively bypassing the intended third-party authorization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or integrity checks on the `publicKeys` field within the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest`. The third party authority blindly trusts the provided public keys, enabling a malicious user to substitute them with their own.",
       "Incorrect handling of public keys in token symbol tables during third-party block generation."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass third-party authorization. Specifically, tokens that should require third-party blocks from specific authorities can be used without obtaining the actual third-party block from the correct authority. This compromises the intended access control mechanism and can potentially allow unauthorized access to resources.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is network-based. A malicious user crafts a manipulated `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` which is then sent to the third-party authority.",
     "The attack vector includes modifying the symbol table in a third-party request"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to forge or modify `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` messages. This likely requires the attacker to have some control over the token or be able to intercept and manipulate the requests. The attacker must also have the ability to generate a new keypair.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to how the biscuit-auth library handles third-party blocks. The intended flow involves a holder of a token requesting a third-party block from a third-party authority. This request should only be possible if the holder had access to the token. However, by manipulating the request, the holder may bypass a required authorization. "

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
