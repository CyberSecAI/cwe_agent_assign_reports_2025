  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear The intent of the error path in xe_migrate_clear is to wait on locally generated fence and then return. The code is waiting on m->fence which could be the local fence but this is only stable under the job mutex leading to a possible UAF. Fix code to wait on local fence. (cherry picked from commit 762b7e95362170b3e13a8704f38d5e47eca4ba74)",
