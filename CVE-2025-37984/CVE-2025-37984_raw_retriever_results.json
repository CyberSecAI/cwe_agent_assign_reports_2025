  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto ecdsa - Harden against integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP() Herbert notes that DIV_ROUND_UP() may overflow unnecessarily if an ecdsa implementations ->key_size() callback returns an unusually large value. Herbert instead suggests (for a division by 8) X / 8 + !!(X & 7) Based on this formula, introduce a generic DIV_ROUND_UP_POW2() macro and use it in lieu of DIV_ROUND_UP() for ->key_size() return values. Additionally, use the macro in ecc_digits_from_bytes(), whose nbytes parameter is a ->key_size() return value in some instances, or a user-specified ASN.1 length in the case of ecdsa_get_signature_rs().",
