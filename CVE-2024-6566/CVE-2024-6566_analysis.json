  "description": "The Aramex Shipping WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.21. This is due the plugin not preventing direct access to the composer-setup.php file which also has display_errors enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6566:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-6566. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions \"Aramex Shipping WooCommerce <= 1.1.21 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure\" and includes the CVE identifier. The description aligns with the vulnerability as a Full Path Disclosure due to direct access to the `composer-setup.php` file.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of access control on the `composer-setup.php` file within the Aramex Shipping WooCommerce plugin. This file, intended for internal use, is directly accessible to unauthenticated users and outputs errors with `display_errors` enabled. This reveals the full path of the web application.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin fails to restrict direct access to the `composer-setup.php` file.\n*   **Information Disclosure:**  The `composer-setup.php` file has `display_errors` enabled, which outputs the full file path when accessed directly.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the web application's installation directory.\n*   **Aid to Further Attacks:** The disclosed path can assist attackers in exploiting other vulnerabilities by providing precise location details for file system interactions.\n*   The impact is considered low, as this information alone is not directly damaging, but it can greatly assist a targeted attack.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct URL Access:**  An attacker can access the vulnerable file (`composer-setup.php`) directly using its URL.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any user account or privileges on the target system.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the web application and request the vulnerable file.\n*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable file:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `composer-setup.php` file within the plugin.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCVE-2024-6566 is a Full Path Disclosure vulnerability in the Aramex Shipping WooCommerce plugin. By directly accessing the `composer-setup.php` file, an unauthenticated attacker can discover the server's full file path due to the file having `display_errors` enabled. This information, while not immediately damaging, can facilitate further attacks.",

CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a broader category that encompasses CWE-548. CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] relates to the method of accessing the file, but the core issue is the information exposure itself. Therefore, I chose the most specific CWE (CWE-548) as the primary and included the others as secondary candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe548[\"CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe548 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe548\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe548 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **missing access control** on the `composer-setup.php` file, leading to **direct access** via a URL (CWE-425). The `composer-setup.php` file has `display_errors` enabled, which causes the full file path to be displayed, resulting in **information exposure** (CWE-548). This **information exposure** can then aid further attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based primarily on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states the root cause is the lack of access control on the `composer-setup.php` file, and the file outputs errors with `display_errors` enabled, revealing the full path of the web application. I have chosen CWE-548 [Information Exposure Through Directory Listing] as the primary CWE because it most accurately describes the specific vulnerability: the exposure of the full path of the web application due to a file being directly accessible and displaying errors. While CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is also relevant, it is a broader category. CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] is relevant because the file is being accessed directly without authorization, but this is the means of access, not the core weakness. The relationship graph helped to clarify that CWE-548 is a specific type of CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
