  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk bcm dvp Assign ->num before accessing ->hws Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in clk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed UBSAN **array-index-out-of-bounds** in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c592 index 0 is out of range for type struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num) (aka struct clk_hw *[]) Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which clears up the warning.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-39462.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds access in the `clk_dvp_probe()` function within the Linux kernel's clock framework. The `hws` member of the `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` is accessed before the `num` member, which specifies the size of the `hws` array, is initialized. This leads to a situation where the bounds sanitizer detects that the array is being accessed out of bounds because the size is still zero.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Out-of-bounds array access:** The `hws` array is accessed before its size, indicated by `num`, is set, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **UBSAN warning:** While the code was triggering a warning from the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN), the code was not crashing or corrupting data. The primary impact is the warning, indicating a bug that needs fixing to avoid potential future issues, even if there are no current exploitable consequences.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- There is no information provided indicating that this is an exploitable vulnerability. The provided information indicates this would be detected via the bounds sanitizer.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Not applicable, the issue is triggered internally by the code, not through external attack vectors.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix involves moving the initialization of `data->num` to before the access to `data->hws`.\n- The vulnerability is present in the `drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c` file.\n- This issue was introduced by commit `f316cdff8d67`.\n- The fix has been applied to the stable kernel branch.\n- Multiple commits address this issue, they all contain the same fix, for the same issue.",
