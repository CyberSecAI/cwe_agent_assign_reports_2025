# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-27438

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter Visualization V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.13), Teamcenter Visualization V2312 (All versions < V2312.0009), Teamcenter Visualization V2406 (All versions < V2406.0007), Teamcenter Visualization V2412 (All versions < V2412.0002), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 (All versions < V2302.0021), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0010). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure** while parsing specially crafted WRL files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

The provided content is relevant to CVE-2025-27438. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted WRL files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted WRL file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the affected application reads the malicious WRL file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious WRL file. (User Interaction Required)
*   Local Access

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Update Teamcenter Visualization to V14.3.0.13 or later.
*   Update Teamcenter Visualization to V2312.0009 or later.
*   Update Teamcenter Visualization to V2406.0007 or later.
*   Update Teamcenter Visualization to V2412.0002 or later.
*   Update Tecnomatix Plant Simulation to V2302.0021 or later.
*   Update Tecnomatix Plant Simulation to V2404.0010 or later.
*   Do not open untrusted WRL files in affected applications.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8
