## Vulnerability Description
The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the page_id parameter of the wpjobportal_deactivate() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11713

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and a lack of proper preparation in the SQL query within the `wpjobportal_deactivate()` function. Specifically, the `page_id` parameter, intended for use in a SQL query, is not sanitized or parameterized correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `page_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database by appending their own SQL queries to the existing query.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.
* **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with Administrator-level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to make requests.

**Additional Details:**
* **Affected Plugin:** The vulnerability exists in the "WP Job Portal" plugin.
* **Affected Versions:** Versions 2.2.2 and below are vulnerable.
* **Patched Version:** Version 2.2.3 and later include a fix.
* The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the `$id` is numeric before using it in the query.
* The vulnerable code can be found in the `deactivation.php` file within the plugin.
