# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41781

## Vulnerability Description
IBM PowerVM Platform KeyStore (IBM PowerVM Hypervisor FW950.00 through FW950.90, FW1030.00 through FW1030.60,FW1050.00 throughFW1050.20, and FW1060.00 through FW1060.10functionality can be compromised if an attacker gains service access to the HMC. An attacker that gains service access to the HMC can locate and through a series of service procedures decrypt data contained in the Platform KeyStore.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** decrypt data contained in the Platform KeyStore
- **vector:** series of service procedures
