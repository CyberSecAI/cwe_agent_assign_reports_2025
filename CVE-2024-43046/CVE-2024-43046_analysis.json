It is related to the broader Class CWE-404.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe226 primary\n    class cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **memory re-allocation**, which leads to sensitive information being present in the re-allocated memory. This sensitive information is then disclosed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is limited. The key phrase \"memory re-allocation\" suggests a potential weakness related to resource management and information exposure. The vulnerability description directly mentions \"information disclosure\" as the impact.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). However, these CWEs don't directly address the core issue of sensitive information remaining in memory after re-allocation.\n\nCWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **weakness** of sensitive information not being cleared from memory before re-allocation. This aligns with the vulnerability description's focus on information disclosure during **memory re-allocation**. The description does not state that the size is excessive which eliminates CWE-789. The description doesn't state the release is incorrect which eliminates CWE-404.\n\nCWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release) is considered as a secondary CWE because it is a more general class that encompasses the specific issue of failing to clear sensitive information before reuse.\n\nThe confidence is moderate (0.7) due to the limited information provided in the vulnerability description. More details about the specific memory management functions involved would increase confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
