While CWE-200 is a broader category, CWE-532 provides a more precise classification. There aren't clear chain relationships evident in the provided information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** APM server logs could contain parts of the document body from a partially failed bulk index request (**WEAKNESS**).\n2.  **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information in APM Server error logs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-532 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that sensitive information is being written to log files, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-532. The retriever results also list CWE-532 as a top candidate.\n\nCWE-200 was considered, but it is a higher-level class that describes the general case of sensitive information exposure. Since CWE-532 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, it is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-532 is strong: \"APM server logs could contain parts of the document body from a partially failed bulk index request... this could disclose sensitive information in APM Server error logs.\" This directly indicates that sensitive information is being inserted into log files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
