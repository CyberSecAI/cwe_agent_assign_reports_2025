## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. This affects the function H5HL__fl_deserialize of the file src/H5HLcache.c. The manipulation of the argument free_block leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of free_block argument
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** up to 1.14.6
- **component:** H5HL__fl_deserialize function of src/H5HLcache.c file

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2924 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the HDF5 library. The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs because the `H5HL__fl_deserialize` function does not validate the `free_block` value before using it to calculate an address into the `dblk_image` buffer.  If `free_block` is a large number, it can cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `heap->dblk_image + free_block`. Specifically, the `H5_DECODE_LENGTH_LEN` function is called with an invalid address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** CWE-122.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to check if `free_block` is within the valid bounds of the `dblk_image` buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a segmentation fault and application crash.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap buffer overflow can potentially be exploited for code execution, depending on the surrounding memory layout and other factors.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious HDF5 File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted HDF5 file that causes the `free_block` variable to have a large value.
*   **Fuzzing:** The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability can be triggered through fuzzing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create and provide a malicious HDF5 file to the vulnerable application.
*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing the file, not by requiring elevated privileges.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state the fix, but it implies that input validation should be added to the `H5HL__fl_deserialize` function to ensure that `free_block` is within the valid bounds of the `dblk_image` buffer before using it to calculate an address.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** hdf5 v1.14.6
*   **Priority:** Blocker (must be merged for release)
*   **Milestone:** Release 2.0.0
*   **PoC:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, including build instructions and a crash file.
*   **ASan Report:** The content includes an AddressSanitizer (ASan) report showing the location of the heap-buffer-overflow.
