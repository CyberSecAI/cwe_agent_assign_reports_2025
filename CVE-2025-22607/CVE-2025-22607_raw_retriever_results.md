## Query
Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to fetch the details page for any GitHub / GitLab configuration on a Coolify instance by only knowing the UUID of the model. This exposes the client id, client secret and webhook secret. Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes this issue.
