Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the **missing authorization** allows any authenticated user to fetch the details page for any GitHub / GitLab configuration on a Coolify instance by only knowing the UUID of the model. This exposes the client id, client secret and webhook secret. Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes this issue.",

However, since the vulnerability description indicates the user is authenticated, these CWEs were not used. CWE-862 Missing Authorization was selected as the primary CWE. The relationships between CWE-862, CWE-863, and CWE-285 were considered, ensuring that CWE-862 was the most appropriate due to the **missing authorization** check. CWE-200 can follow CWE-862 to show the exposure of sensitive information due to the **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the **missing authorization** allows any authenticated user to fetch details of GitHub/GitLab configurations. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nThe retriever results and enhanced context were analyzed to confirm this assessment. The guidance on Authentication vs. Authorization was particularly helpful in distinguishing between authentication and authorization issues.\n\nCWE-862 was chosen over other related CWEs like CWE-285 and CWE-863 because the application completely **lacked** the authorization check, rather than having an improper or incorrect one.\n\nCWE-200 was added as a secondary weakness due to the exposure of sensitive information as a direct result of the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the available evidence and the CWE specifications, ensuring the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
