CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) are child CWEs that are more specific. The choice of CWE-284 is because the vulnerability is described as **improper access control**, and it is unclear whether the issue stems from authentication or authorization failures specifically. If more information was available to pinpoint the exact cause, one of the child CWEs (CWE-863 or CWE-306) would be preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, which leads to a potential denial of service.\n\nImproper Access Control -> Potential Denial of Service\n\nCWE-284 is the root cause. The impact is denial of service, which isn't explicitly mapped to a CWE but is the ultimate consequence.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, which aligns with CWE-284. The retriever results also show CWE-284 as a relevant candidate. Given the limited information, and the guidance to use a more specific CWE if the root cause is clear, CWE-284 is the most appropriate choice at this time. If there was more information available to pinpoint whether the **improper access control** was due to lack of authentication or incorrect authorization, then it would be appropriate to change the CWE to CWE-306 or CWE-863 respectively.\n\nThe evidence provided focuses on the **improper access control**, without clearly indicating whether it is an authentication or authorization issue. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-863 and CWE-306 are children of CWE-284, providing a hierarchy that guides the selection of the most specific CWE when possible.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, given the available information. CWE-284 is chosen because the nature of the access control issue is not fully clarified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** - The product does not adequately control access to resources or functions, allowing unintended access. This is a high-level category used when the specific cause of the access control issue is unclear. The description states \"**Improper access control** for some Intel(R) Arc &amp Iris(R) Xe graphics software...may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\" The guidance indicates this should be avoided if a more specific child CWE is appropriate.\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization** - The product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. If the **improper access control** stems from a flawed authorization check, this CWE would be more appropriate. The description doesn't specify this, so it is only a secondary candidate.\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** - The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity. If the **improper access control** stems from a missing authentication check, this CWE would be more appropriate. The description doesn't specify this, so it is only a secondary candidate.",
