## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the Task Manager component of Synology BeePhotos and Synology Photos. This is a command injection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection. The application fails to properly sanitize or escape special characters used in commands, allowing an attacker to inject their own commands.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via unspecified vectors. This means that the attack can be performed over a network without requiring local access to the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N). This indicates that the vulnerability is easily exploitable if the affected system is reachable.

**Affected Products (with versions):**

*   Synology BeePhotos:
    *   Versions prior to 1.0.2-10026
    *   Versions prior to 1.1.0-10053
*   Synology Photos:
    *   Versions prior to 1.6.2-0720
    *   Versions prior to 1.7.0-0795

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was reported by PWN2OWN 2024 (ZDI-CAN-25623)
