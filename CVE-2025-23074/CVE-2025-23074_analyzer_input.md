## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-23074 Analysis

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-23074. It provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `Special:EditProfile` page in the SocialProfile extension does not respect the visibility settings (everyone/friends/friends of friends/hidden) of profile fields. This allows users with the `editothersprofiles` user right to view the contents of profile fields that should be hidden from them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Privileged users can access sensitive information that they are not authorized to view.
*   **Access Control Failure:** The application fails to enforce proper access control to profile data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker with the `editothersprofiles` user right can view sensitive information from other users' profiles, even if those fields are marked as hidden. This could include personal details, contact information, or other private data.  The description also notes a potential issue where editing a hidden field with the `Special:EditProfile` page could overwrite the data, which is also undesirable.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  An attacker must have the `editothersprofiles` user right.
2.  The attacker navigates to `Special:EditProfile/User` for a target user.
3.  The attacker can then view the contents of profile fields that should be hidden from them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with the `editothersprofiles` user right. This right is granted to members of a specific group.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability was fixed by adding UserProfilePage-like visibility checks to the `Special:EditProfile` page.  The fix ensures that users only see profile fields that they are authorized to view, based on the field's visibility settings. The fix was implemented in Gerrit commits 1110835, 1111306, and 1111307 and merged into the `master`, `REL1_41`, and `REL1_42` branches of the `mediawiki/extensions/SocialProfile` repository.
