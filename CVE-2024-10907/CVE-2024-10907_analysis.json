  "description": "In lm-sys/fastchat Release v0.2.36, the server fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries. This flaw can be exploited by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters at the end of the boundary. Each extra character is processed in an infinite loop, leading to excessive resource consumption and a complete denial of service (DoS) for all users. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user login or interaction is required for an attacker to exploit this issue.",

It is related to CWE-834, Excessive Iteration (Class), as a child. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"infinite loop,\" making CWE-835 a strong match. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE that can result from CWE-835. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) could also lead to resource consumption, and shares a peer relationship with CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), which was also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe400 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe835\n    cwe770 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** that fails to handle excessive characters appended to multipart boundaries. This leads to an **infinite loop** (CWE-835), which in turn results in **excessive resource consumption** and ultimately a **denial of service** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the **infinite loop** caused by **improper handling of excessive characters in multipart boundaries**. The description states that \"Each extra character is processed in an infinite loop\". The retriever results also list CWE-835 as a potential match.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. The selection of CWE-835 is based on the explicit mention of an \"infinite loop\" in the vulnerability description. CWE-400 and CWE-770 were considered due to their relationship to resource consumption and DoS, but they are consequences of the primary weakness (the loop).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
