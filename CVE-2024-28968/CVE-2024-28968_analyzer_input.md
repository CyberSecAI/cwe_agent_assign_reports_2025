# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-28968

## Vulnerability Description
Dell SCG, versions prior to 5.24.00.00, contain an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability in the SCG exposed for internal email and collection settings REST APIs (if enabled by Admin user from UI). A remote low privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of certain APIs applicable only for Admin Users on the applications backend database that could potentially allow an unauthorized user access to restricted resources and change of state.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Access Control**
- **impact:** unauthorized user access to restricted resources and change of state
- **attacker:** remote low privileged attacker
- **product:** Dell SCG
- **version:** versions prior to 5.24.00.00
- **component:** SCG exposed for internal email and collection settings REST APIs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control: Internal email and collection settings REST APIs are exposed without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged attacker can execute APIs intended for admin users, potentially leading to:
  - Unauthorized access to restricted resources.
  - Change of state on the application's backend database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access.
- Exploitation of the exposed internal REST APIs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileged access to the network where SCG is accessible.
- Knowledge of the exposed internal email and collection settings REST APIs (if enabled by an Admin user from UI).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
