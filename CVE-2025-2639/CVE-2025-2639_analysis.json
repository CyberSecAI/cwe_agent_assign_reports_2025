CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization\", is a peer of CWE-862 and also a child of CWE-284. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by preferring the more specific CWE-862, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -- PEEROF --> cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing authorization** check, leading to unauthorized access.\n- The root cause is the **lack of authorization** (CWE-862).\n- The impact is unauthorized access to the affected component.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to an authorization issue due to the explicit mention of **\"improper authorization\"** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also prioritize CWE-862 \"Missing Authorization\", and CWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\".\n\nThe CWE guidance clearly distinguishes between authentication and authorization issues, advising that CWE-862 should be preferred when authorization checks are missing.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-862 because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **\"improper authorization\"**, indicating a **missing authorization** check. While CWE-285 is a valid alternative, it's less precise than CWE-862. CWE-284 is considered a high-level category and is less appropriate when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately reflects the **missing authorization**, providing a clear and actionable classification for the vulnerability. The confidence in this mapping is high, given the direct evidence and the support from the retriever results and CWE guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant as the issue is not related to reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to authorization, CWE-425 is less specific than CWE-862, as it describes a broader issue of inadequate enforcement, whereas the vulnerability description indicates a **missing** check.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant, as the vulnerability is not about external control of assumed immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant, as there is no mention of user-controlled keys in the description.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
