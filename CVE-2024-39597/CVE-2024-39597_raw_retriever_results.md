In SAP Commerce, a user can misuse the forgotten password functionality to gain access to a Composable Storefront B2B site for which early login and registration is activated, without requiring the merchant to approve the account beforehand. If the site is not configured as isolated site, this can also grant access to other non-isolated early login sites, even if registration is not enabled for those other sites.
