## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
*   A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified within the "/admin/profile.php" file of the "Time Table Generator System" project. The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code via the parameter "adminname". This input is then directly rendered in the web page without undergoing proper sanitization or output encoding processes.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Stored XSS

Impact of exploitation:
*   Exploiting this XSS vulnerability allows attackers to steal user session cookies, perform actions on behalf of authenticated users, capture sensitive user input (such as login credentials), and modify the appearance or content of the web page.

Attack vectors:
*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code via the "adminname" parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "adminname" parameter.

Mitigation or fix:
*   1.  Implement proper output encoding: Always encode user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or URLs. Use context-specific encoding functions provided by your programming language or framework.
    2.  Perform strict input validation: Validate and sanitize all user input on both the client and server sides to ensure it adheres to expected formats and does not contain malicious content.
    3.  Leverage Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser can load and execute scripts. This helps mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of unauthorized scripts.
    4.  Use HttpOnly cookies: Mark session cookies with the HttpOnly flag to prevent them from being accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of session hijacking through XSS attacks.
