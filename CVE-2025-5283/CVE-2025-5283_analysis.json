CWE-119 is a more general class of memory corruption vulnerabilities. The relationship between these CWEs is a parent-child relationship, where CWE-416 is a specific type of CWE-119.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** (**CWE-416**), potentially leading to heap corruption. The root cause is the **improper** handling of memory, allowing access to freed memory locations. The impact is heap corruption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **use-after-free** (**CWE-416**) vulnerability. This is supported by the vulnerability description that explicitly states \"**Use after free** in libvpx...\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as \"**Use after free** in libvpx\". The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top candidate CWE.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer) is considered because CWE-416 is a variant of it.
