# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0650

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the Open Virtual Network (OVN). Specially crafted UDP packets may bypass egress access control lists (ACLs) in OVN installations configured with a logical switch with DNS records set on it and if the same switch has any egress ACLs configured. This issue can lead to unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers running on the OVN network.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** specially crafted UDP packets
- **product:** Open Virtual Network
- **impact:** unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers running on the OVN network, bypass egress access control lists (ACLs)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

**1.  Content Relates to CVE-2025-0650?**

*   YES. The content explicitly mentions CVE-2025-0650 and describes the vulnerability.

**2.  Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability arises due to the interaction between OVN's DNS caching feature and egress ACL rules. Specifically, the OpenFlow rules installed by OVN, when DNS caching is enabled, allow specially crafted UDP packets to bypass egress ACL rules.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Egress ACL bypass.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers running on the OVN network.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting a UDP packet to bypass egress ACL rules.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted UDP packets.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Disable DNS caching in OVN by clearing the "dns\_records" column of all logical switches.
        *   Adjust ACLs from being evaluated on egress ("to-lport") to being evaluated on ingress ("from-lport").
        *   Adjust the topology of the virtual network so that DNS caching and egress ACLs are not on the same logical switch.
    *   **Fix:**
        *   Apply patches provided for specific OVN versions (22.03.x, 24.03.x, 24.09.x).
        *   Upgrade to a known patched version of OVN (v22.03.8, v24.03.5, v24.09.2).

**3.  More detail than the official CVE description?**

*   YES.  The content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the conditions under which it occurs, mitigation steps, and links to patches.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
