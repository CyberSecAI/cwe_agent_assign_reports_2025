  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-25362: Spacy-LLM Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability\n\n**This content is relevant to the CVE.**\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the usage of unsafe functions of the Jinja2 template engine in `spacy_llm/tasks/builtin_task.py`. Specifically, the `generate_prompts` and `render_template` functions utilize Jinja2 without proper sandboxing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) - CWE-94\n*   Improper Input Validation - CWE-1336\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can run arbitrary system commands without restriction, potentially gaining complete control over the server host (Remote Code Execution).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.\n*   Crafted payload: Attackers can inject a malicious payload into the `template` field of the configuration.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No privileges required.\n*   No user interaction is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by sandboxing the Jinja2 environment (see [explosion/spacy-llm#491](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/pull/491)). However, versions <= 0.7.2 are still vulnerable.  Upgrade to version 0.7.3 or later.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **PoC:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the execution of the `id` command and the creation of a file named \"pwned\" on the server.\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 0.7.2\n*   **Patched versions:** 0.7.3\n*   **CVSS v4 Score:** 8.9 (High Severity)\n    *   Attack Vector: Network\n    *   Attack Complexity: Low\n    *   Attack Requirements: None\n    *   Privileges Required: None\n    *   User Interaction: None\n    *   Confidentiality: High\n    *   Integrity: High\n    *   Availability: High\n*   **EPSS score:** 0.119% (32nd percentile)\n*   **References:**\n    *   [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25362](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25362)\n    *   [explosion/spacy-llm#492](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/issues/492)\n    *   [explosion/spacy-llm#491](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/pull/491)\n    *   [explosion/spacy-llm@8bde049](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/commit/8bde0490cc1e9de9dd2e84480b7b5cd18a94d739)\n    *   [https://www.hacktivesecurity.com/blog/2025/04/01/cve-2025-25362-old-vulnerabilities-new-victims-breaking-llm-prompts-with-ssti](https://www.hacktivesecurity.com/blog/2025/04/01/cve-2025-25362-old-vulnerabilities-new-victims-breaking-llm-prompts-with-ssti)",

CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-1336, but CWE-1336 is more specific to this vulnerability. The chain relationship shows that improper neutralization in a template engine (CWE-1336) can lead to code injection (CWE-94) and ultimately, arbitrary code execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine (CWE-1336)**, which leads to **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-94)**, and ultimately results in arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Server-Side Template Injection** as the primary weakness, which aligns with CWE-1336. This assessment is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"Server-Side Template Injection\" and the ability to \"execute arbitrary code via injecting a crafted payload into the template field.\" The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, stating that the vulnerability is caused by \"the usage of unsafe functions of the Jinja2 template engine\" and that attackers can \"run arbitrary system commands without restriction.\" The high similarity scores for CWE-1336 in the Retriever Results also support this classification.
