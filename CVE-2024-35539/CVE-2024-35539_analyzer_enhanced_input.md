## Vulnerability Description
Typecho v1.3.0 was discovered to contain a **race condition** vulnerability in the post commenting function. This vulnerability allows attackers to post several comments before the spam protection checks if the comments are posted too frequently.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **impact:** post several comments before spam protection checks
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Typecho
- **version:** v1.3.0
- **component:** post commenting function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-35539:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the comment spam protection logic within the `var/Widget/Feedback.php` file. The protection checks if a user has commented within a specified time interval, and rejects comments made within that time frame. However, the implementation has a race condition, as it's possible for an attacker to send multiple comments in the time window right before the protection kicks in, or just outside the time frame covered by the protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The time-based spam protection mechanism doesn't handle concurrent requests properly, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended rate limiting.
- **Inadequate Time Interval Check:** The protection logic has a gap, allowing for multiple comments to be posted within the second separating time ranges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Comment Spam:** An attacker can bypass the spam protection and post a large number of comments in a short amount of time, effectively flooding the comment sections of posts. This can lead to disruption and a degraded user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the application's comment posting functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be an authenticated user, the vulnerability is in the unauthenticated comment posting functionality.
- **Ability to send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the comment endpoint.
