  "description": "authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs//view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs//view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42490:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Improper authorization checks on several API endpoints. Specifically, these endpoints could be accessed by users without the correct authentication and authorization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Insufficient authorization controls. Certain API endpoints did not properly verify if the user had the necessary permissions to access them.\n- Exposure of sensitive information (certificate data, private keys)\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality breach**: Unauthorized access to certificate data and private keys.\n- **Integrity impact**: potential for modification of resources due to the `/used_by` endpoint being exposed.\n- While not directly mentioned, unauthorized access could potentially lead to further attacks if the exposed credentials are used elsewhere.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network-based attacks. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through network requests to the affected API endpoints.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Attackers need knowledge of the UUID of the targeted objects (e.g., Certificate Key Pair). While the UUIDs are not easily guessable (UUIDv4), an attacker with some access to the system or prior knowledge could obtain them.\n- No user interaction is required. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by simply sending a request to the vulnerable endpoints.\n- No privileges are required.\n\n**Affected API Endpoints:**\n- `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/`\n- `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/`\n- `/api/v3/.../used_by/` (note: the exact path is not specified in the content)\n\n**Patches:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in authentik versions 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4, and 2024.8.0.\n\n**Workarounds:**\n- Access to the vulnerable API endpoints can be blocked at a reverse proxy or load balancer level.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, categorized as High severity.\n- The vulnerability was reported by @m2a2.\n- The fix involves adding an `ObjectFilter` to the `filter_backends` of the affected API endpoints, indicating that this filter was missing and caused the improper authorization checks.",

The vulnerability description states that certain API endpoints can be accessed \"without correct authentication/authorization.\" This indicates a potential lack of both authentication and authorization checks. Given the guidance to consider authentication first, CWE-306 is chosen as the primary weakness. If a user is not authenticated, authorization checks are irrelevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** for critical API endpoints (CWE-306). This leads to the possibility of **missing authorization** (CWE-862) because if no identity is established, authorization checks cannot be effectively performed. The impact of this chain is unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential modification of resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the phrase \"**missing authentication/authorization**.\" The CWE guidance clearly distinguishes between these two concepts, prioritizing authentication as the first step in access control. Since the API endpoints can be accessed without proper authentication, CWE-306 is the most appropriate primary mapping. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that \"these endpoints could be accessed by users without the correct authentication and authorization\". While authorization is also **missing**, the absence of authentication is the root cause that enables the subsequent authorization bypass. The graph relationships helped to visualize the connection between authentication, authorization, and access control, solidifying the choice of CWE-306 as the primary weakness. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the **missing authentication** and **missing authorization** aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
