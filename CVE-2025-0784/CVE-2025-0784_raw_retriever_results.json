  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in Intelbras InControl up to 2.21.58 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /v1/usuario/ of the component Registered User Handler. The manipulation leads to cleartext transmission of sensitive information. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.21.59 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
