## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-770, which describes the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, leading to potential resource exhaustion. CWE-400 is a broader class describing uncontrolled resource consumption, and while relevant, it's less specific than CWE-770. CWE-789 is also related, as excessive memory allocation can be a consequence of the lack of limits, but it's a more specific case of resource exhaustion.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)** by the `PushSessionCacheFilter` due to the **lack of limits or throttling**, leading to **excessive memory allocation (CWE-789)** and ultimately resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** and denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section, which provides detailed information about the root cause and weaknesses. The key phrase "PushSessionCacheFilter creates a session for every request, without proper limits, leading to potential memory exhaustion" directly supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary weakness.

The graph relationships show that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and a parent of CWE-789, indicating that it's a more specific weakness than CWE-400 and a broader weakness than CWE-789. This supports the choice of CWE-770 as the primary weakness, as it's the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, which is less specific than CWE-770. CWE-789 is a Variant-level CWE, which is more specific than CWE-770, but it only represents one aspect of the vulnerability (memory allocation).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
