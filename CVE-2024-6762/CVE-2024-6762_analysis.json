  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6762:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe `PushSessionCacheFilter` in Jetty allows unauthenticated users to create sessions which can consume server memory. An attacker can exploit this by sending numerous requests, each creating a new session, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The `PushSessionCacheFilter` creates a session for every request, without proper limits, leading to potential memory exhaustion.\n- Lack of proper session management: The filter does not effectively manage the number of sessions it creates, nor are there safeguards to prevent excessive session creation by unauthenticated users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the server.\n- Attack Complexity: High. While the attack is simple in principle, it requires a high degree of coordination, rate, and duration to exhaust the server memory.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction on the server. They only need network access to the affected server.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send multiple requests to the server to cause memory exhaustion.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability exists in `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-servlets` versions >=10.0.0, <=10.0.17, >=11.0.0, <=11.0.17, and >=12.0.0, <=12.0.3.\n- Patched versions include 10.0.18, 11.0.18, and 12.0.4.\n- The `PushCacheFilter` was also deprecated and removed because of similar issues.\n- Workarounds include disabling `PushCacheFilter`, reducing the idle timeout for unauthenticated sessions, or configuring session passivation to store sessions in a database or file system rather than in memory.\n\nThe information provided is more detailed than the description in the CVE. The CVE description is a placeholder, while the information from the provided documents details the root cause, impact, and affected versions.",

CWE-400 is a broader class describing uncontrolled resource consumption, and while relevant, it's less specific than CWE-770. CWE-789 is also related, as excessive memory allocation can be a consequence of the lack of limits, but it's a more specific case of resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)** by the `PushSessionCacheFilter` due to the **lack of limits or throttling**, leading to **excessive memory allocation (CWE-789)** and ultimately resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which provides detailed information about the root cause and weaknesses. The key phrase \"PushSessionCacheFilter creates a session for every request, without proper limits, leading to potential memory exhaustion\" directly supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and a parent of CWE-789, indicating that it's a more specific weakness than CWE-400 and a broader weakness than CWE-789. This supports the choice of CWE-770 as the primary weakness, as it's the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, which is less specific than CWE-770. CWE-789 is a Variant-level CWE, which is more specific than CWE-770, but it only represents one aspect of the vulnerability (memory allocation).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
