## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1117 based on provided content:

The provided content **relates** to CVE-2025-1117. It details a security vulnerability in the CoinRemitter Opencart module. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   OpenCart's database API lacks prepared statements or parameterized inputs, leaving the module vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Multiple SQLi vulnerabilities exist, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access and manipulate the database.
*   **Hardcoded Encryption:** The encryption details for coinremitter wallet passwords are hardcoded and publicly available, enabling decryption of stolen credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Access to all content stored in the database, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and payment details.
*   **Credential Theft:** Retrieval of API credentials for coinremitter wallets, including unencrypted passwords.
*   **Account Compromise:** Potential compromise of admin accounts and session details.
*   **Financial Loss:** Potential theft from compromised wallets.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Unauthenticated POST requests to specific module endpoints (e.g., `/index.php?route=extension/coinremitter/module/coinremitter_invoice|payment_history`, `/index.php?route=extension/coinremitter/payment/coinremitter|notify`).
*   Exploitation of SQLi vulnerabilities through crafted input parameters.
*   Blind SQLi techniques when error reporting is disabled.
*   Exploitation of hardcoded encryption to decrypt stolen passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required for some exploits.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   Ability to craft malicious POST requests.
*   Access to tools like `sqlmap` for automated exploitation.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Properly validate all unsafe input used in SQL queries.
*   Cast values to numeric formats where appropriate.
*   Use the database driver's escape method to sanitize input.
*   Avoid hardcoding cryptographic keys.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   Specific examples of SQLi payloads are provided.
*   Details on how to decrypt stolen passwords using the hardcoded encryption key.
*   Timeline of vulnerability disclosure and patching.
*   Links to the vulnerable module on OpenCart Marketplace and GitHub.
*   CVSS score: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L 9.9 Critical
*   Vulnerable versions are identified.
*   The Github release notes for version 0.0.3 mention "Security Improved" and "Bug Fixes" which likely address the reported vulnerabilities.
