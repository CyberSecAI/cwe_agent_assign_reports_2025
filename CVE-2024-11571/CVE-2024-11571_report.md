# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11571

## Description

IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24895.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-125, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-125 has parent CWEs that are more general, like CWE-119, but CWE-125 is a better fit because the vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds read. CWE-1284 is related because the root cause is a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. CWE-20 is a very general class-level CWE for Improper Input Validation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**, which can then allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** (CWE-125). The vulnerability description clearly states this, and the CVE reference links content summary also confirms the presence of this weakness. The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This is reflected in the selection of CWE-1284 as a secondary CWE. The retriever results also suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), but the description explicitly mentions "read past the end of an allocated buffer", making CWE-125 the more appropriate choice.

The selection of CWE-125 is strongly supported by the evidence. The retriever results also support this decision, with a high similarity score for CWE-125.

The relationship graph highlights the connection between CWE-125 and its parent CWEs, as well as the link between CWE-1284 and CWE-20, which highlights the root cause of the vulnerability.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-125 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness. CWE-1284 is also a base-level CWE that captures the **lack of proper validation** of user-supplied data.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.
