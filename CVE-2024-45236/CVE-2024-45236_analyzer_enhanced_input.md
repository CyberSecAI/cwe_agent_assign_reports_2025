## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty signedAttributes field. Fort accesses the sets elements without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** crash
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Fort
- **version:** before 1.6.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45236:

**CVE-2024-45236**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Fort not properly handling signed objects with empty `signedAttrs`. Specifically, Fort accesses the elements of the `signedAttrs` set without checking if it's empty.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a missing check for an empty set before accessing its elements, leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a crash, potentially leading to the unavailability of Route Origin Validation.
*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious RPKI repository, which descends from a trusted Trust Anchor, can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty `signedAttributes` field.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control an RPKI repository that a Fort validator instance trusts. This allows the attacker to serve malicious RPKI objects to the vulnerable validator.
