  "description": "An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty signedAttributes field. Fort accesses the sets elements without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.",

Specifically, Fort accesses the elements of the `signedAttrs` set without checking if it's empty.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a missing check for an empty set before accessing its elements, leading to a null pointer dereference.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a crash, potentially leading to the unavailability of Route Origin Validation.\n*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious RPKI repository, which descends from a trusted Trust Anchor, can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty `signedAttributes` field.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control an RPKI repository that a Fort validator instance trusts. This allows the attacker to serve malicious RPKI objects to the vulnerable validator.",

While there are parent Class CWEs like CWE-754 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, CWE-476 provides a more specific and accurate description of the vulnerability. There isn't a clear chain relationship presented in the description, but the presence of an empty set leading to a crash suggests an exceptional condition that is not properly handled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malicious RPKI repository serving a signed object with an empty `signedAttributes` field. This leads to Fort accessing elements of the empty set without a prior check, resulting in a **NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476)** and ultimately a crash. The crash can cause unavailability of Route Origin Validation, which can lead to compromised routing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the description provided, which explicitly states that Fort accesses elements of the `signedAttrs` set without sanitizing it first, leading to a crash. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is a missing check for an empty set before accessing its elements, leading to a **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\nThe graph relationships indicate that CWE-476 is a child of CWE-754. While CWE-754 could be considered, CWE-476 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-476, is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly reflects the technical cause of the crash: a **NULL pointer dereference** due to the **lack of a check for an empty set**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected: While certificates are involved in RPKI, the core issue isn't about host mismatch.*\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected: Path traversal is not relevant to this vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected: HTTP request/response splitting is not relevant to this vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected: External control of file names or paths is not relevant to this vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
