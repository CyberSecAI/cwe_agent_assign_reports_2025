CWE-256 is the more specific case of storing passwords in plaintext, while CWE-522 is a more general case of insufficient protection of credentials. Choosing CWE-256 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **unencrypted storage** of the AsakusaSatellite API keys in the `config.xml` files. This leads directly to the exposure of sensitive information, as users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the keys.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-256 because the **rootcause** is that the \"AsakusaSatellite API keys are **unencrypted**\" This is a direct match for the description of CWE-256, \"Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-256 as the top candidate. The relationship information confirms that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, making it more specific. The evidence from the vulnerability description is clear, providing high confidence in this assessment. CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nJenkins AsakusaSatellite Plugin 0.1.1 and earlier stores **AsakusaSatellite API keys unencrypted** in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller where they can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **AsakusaSatellite API keys unencrypted**\n- **attacker:** users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system\n- **product:** Jenkins AsakusaSatellite Plugin\n- **version:** 0.1.1 and earlier\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n## Analysis of CVE-2025-31727 based on provided content\n\nThis content **relates** to CVE-2025-31727.
