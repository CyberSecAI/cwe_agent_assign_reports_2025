This directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free).\n\nThe evidence is strong, with the KASAN report explicitly mentioning \"slab-use-after-free\" and providing details about the memory access. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-416 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Variant), as it precisely describes the type of memory error occurring in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This is a class-level CWE, not specific enough.
