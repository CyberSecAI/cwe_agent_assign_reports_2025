CWE-59 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of detail. CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following) and CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following) were considered as child/related CWEs, but CWE-59 best describes the core issue. The relationship to higher-level CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was also considered, but CWE-59 offers more specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe61 -->|PEEROF| cwe59\n    cwe59 -->|PARENTOF| cwe61\n    cwe59 -->|PARENTOF| cwe62\n    cwe59 -->|PARENTOF| cwe64\n    cwe59 -->|PARENTOF| cwe65\n    cwe59 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    cwe59 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe363,cwe61,cwe284, cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper symlink handling** (CWE-59), leading to the potential deletion of files for which the application lacks proper permissions. The chain highlights the **improper handling** of link resolution as the root cause, with the unauthorized file deletion being the direct impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the vulnerability stems from **improper symlink handling**. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')). The vulnerability allows an app to delete files it doesn't have permission to delete, which is a direct consequence of **improper link resolution**.\n\nThe retriever results listed several CWEs, with CWE-59 being a good match.\n\n*   CWE-59 is chosen because the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary explicitly mention **improper handling of symlinks**, which directly corresponds to **improper link resolution** as described in CWE-59.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered because the impact is that an app can delete files it shouldn't have permission to delete. However, the root cause is the **improper symlink handling** rather than an authorization check itself being flawed. Thus, CWE-285 is a secondary concern.\n\nTherefore, CWE-59 is the most appropriate and specific CWE to represent this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.64\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-73\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-65\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-64\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-62\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-61\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.526\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf an application or system uses symbolic links (symlinks), then an attacker might be able to cause it to access unintended resources, possibly with elevated privileges.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Compound level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.",
