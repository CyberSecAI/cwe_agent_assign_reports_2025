# Analysis for CVE-2024-45058

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862, which represents the **missing authorization** check that allows unauthorized privilege escalation. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. CWE-266, a Base-level CWE, provides a more specific view of how privileges are incorrectly assigned, which can be seen as a contributing factor. CWE-862 is a parent of other more specific CWEs, but none of them fit the description as well.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) in the `educar_usuario_cad.php` file. This allows an attacker with minimal privileges to send a crafted POST request, manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. By doing so, they can escalate their privileges to an administrator, gaining full control of the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **missing authorization** check, as emphasized in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The `educar_usuario_cad.php` file **does not check** if the user has the necessary permissions to modify their user type, allowing for unauthorized privilege escalation.

The analysis concludes that CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate primary classification because the application lacks the necessary checks to ensure that the user is authorized to change their user type. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a secondary consideration as it explains the nature of how the privilege is incorrectly assigned and provides a deeper understanding of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 2804.94
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
