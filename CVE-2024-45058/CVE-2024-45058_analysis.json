  "description": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the users current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to verify if a user has sufficient privileges to modify their own user type. Any user with the permission to view user type configurations can exploit this flaw to elevate their privileges to an administrator by manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter during a user update.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n-   **Broken Access Control (CWE-269):** The primary weakness is the insufficient authorization check, allowing users to perform actions they shouldn't be permitted to do.\n-   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** Although not explicitly stated, the lack of proper input validation for the `nivel_usuario_` parameter allows the attacker to inject an arbitrary user type.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n-   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to administrator.\n-   **Account Takeover:** With admin rights, an attacker can take over accounts, modify administrative tasks, and perform other malicious actions.\n-   **Data Modification and Loss:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete sensitive data.\n-   **System Compromise:** The entire system is vulnerable to compromise due to unauthorized access and control.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n-   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n-   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low-level user access with permission to view user type configurations.\n-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.\n-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n-   The vulnerability is present in version 2.9 of the i-Educar software.\n-   The vulnerable code is located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, specifically around line 446.\n-   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how a low-privilege user can change their user type to \"Administrator\" by sending a POST request with the `nivel_usuario_` parameter set to the administrator's ID (1 in this case).\n-   The fix was implemented in commit `c25910c`, which adds a `canChange` function that validates if the current user has the required permissions to change the user type.\n-   The `canChange` method allows modification if:\n    1.  The user making the change is an admin.\n    2.  The user being changed doesn't exist.\n    3.  The user being changed is not an admin.\n-   The fix implements an access control check, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.\n-   CVSS v3 score is 8.1 (High).\n\nThis detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.",

CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. CWE-266, a Base-level CWE, provides a more specific view of how privileges are incorrectly assigned, which can be seen as a contributing factor.

This allows an attacker with minimal privileges to send a crafted POST request, manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. By doing so, they can escalate their privileges to an administrator, gaining full control of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authorization** check, as emphasized in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The `educar_usuario_cad.php` file **does not check** if the user has the necessary permissions to modify their user type, allowing for unauthorized privilege escalation.\n\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate primary classification because the application lacks the necessary checks to ensure that the user is authorized to change their user type. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a secondary consideration as it explains the nature of how the privilege is incorrectly assigned and provides a deeper understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2804.94\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
