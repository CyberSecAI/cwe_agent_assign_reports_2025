The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CWE-77\" as a weakness. However, based on the description and the ability to execute arbitrary commands, CWE-78, which is a more specific case of CWE-77, is selected as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78 helped refine the selection to the more specific CWE-78. The vulnerability description clearly states that authenticated users can execute arbitrary commands by sending a crafted request, which aligns with the characteristics of OS Command Injection.\n\nCWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in OS commands, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   **CWE-77:** Considered but not chosen as the primary because it is a more general case of command injection.
