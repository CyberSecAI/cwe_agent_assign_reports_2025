While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, it accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability. The relationship with CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), helps pinpoint the root cause of how the resource consumption is being triggered. The analysis focused on identifying the initial action (uploading a malicious file) and the subsequent impact (resource exhaustion).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a high-privileged user's ability to upload a maliciously crafted osquery pack (CWE-434). This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), ultimately affecting the availability of Kibana, resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because the vulnerability description and reference links content summary clearly indicate that the attack vector leads to resource exhaustion. The evidence includes \"affect the availability of Kibana\" and \"Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the ability to upload custom osquery packs.\"\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves uploading a maliciously crafted file, which is the mechanism by which the resource consumption is triggered.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-431 (Missing Handler), CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')), and CWE-612 (Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information). However, these CWEs do not accurately capture the essence of the vulnerability, which is the uncontrolled consumption of resources leading to a denial-of-service. The selection of CWE-400 and CWE-434 is at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 describing the high-level impact and CWE-434 detailing the method of attack.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a search index of private or sensitive documents, but it does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
