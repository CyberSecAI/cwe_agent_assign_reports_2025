## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4741. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause:** A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/pages/purchase\_add.php' file of the 'Sales and Inventory System' project. The reason is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs through the 'id' parameter in the '/pages/purchase\_add.php' file. No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific position or privileges are required; the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Example:**
