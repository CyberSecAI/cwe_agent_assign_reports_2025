  "description": "ToolHive is a utility designed to simplify the deployment and management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Due to the ordering of code used to start an MCP server container, versions of ToolHive prior to 0.0.33 inadvertently **store secrets in the run config files** which are used to restart stopped containers. This means that an attacker who has access to the home folder of the user who starts the MCP server can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself. This only applies to secrets which were used in containers whose run configs exist at a point in time - other secrets remaining inaccessible. ToolHive 0.0.33 fixes the issue. Some workarounds are available. Stop and delete any running MCP servers, or manually remove any runconfigs from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/toolhive/runconfigs/` (macOS) or `$HOME/.state/toolhive/runconfigs/` (Linux).",

CWE-212 and CWE-257 were considered as related weaknesses due to the nature of the stored data and the potential for exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    \n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe532\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe532\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe212,cwe257 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **storing secrets in run config files** (CWE-532), potentially due to **improper removal of sensitive information** (CWE-212), which leads to **storing passwords/secrets in a recoverable format** (CWE-257) since the stored configs are not encrypted. The impact is that an attacker with access to the home folder can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **insertion of secrets into run config files**, which directly aligns with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). The retriever results also listed CWE-532 as the top result. The description explicitly states that the ToolHive application inadvertently **stores secrets in the run config files**. This maps directly to the description of CWE-532, where a product writes sensitive information to a log file, or in this case, a configuration file used similarly to a log. This file resides in the user's home directory, making it accessible to local attackers. The vulnerability exists because the ToolHive application does not properly manage the storage of secrets, leading to their unintended exposure.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) is a secondary consideration. It's possible that the root cause involves a failure to sanitize or remove sensitive data before writing it to the configuration file. The vulnerability description mentions \"inadvertently store secrets,\" suggesting a lack of proper handling.\n\nCWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) is also a secondary consideration because, even though the information is not necessarily a password, it is a secret stored in a recoverable format.\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the direct correspondence between the vulnerability description and CWE-532.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
