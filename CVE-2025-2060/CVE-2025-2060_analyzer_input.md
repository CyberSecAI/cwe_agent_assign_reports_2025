## Analysis of CVE-2025-2060 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-2060. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal-Source code V1.0".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'contactnumber' parameter in the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `contactnumber` parameter in a POST request to `/admin/admin-profile.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**
