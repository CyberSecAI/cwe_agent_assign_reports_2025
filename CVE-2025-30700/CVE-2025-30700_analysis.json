  "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris product of Oracle Systems (component Pluggable authentication module). The supported version that is affected is 11. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Solaris. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Solaris accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.5 (Confidentiality impacts).

The description clearly indicates a **missing authentication** issue, leading to the selection of CWE-306.

This results in the exposure of sensitive system information (CWE-497).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description indicates a **missing authentication** mechanism for a critical function within the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) in Oracle Solaris. This allows a low-privileged attacker with network access to potentially compromise the system, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nThe guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control was instrumental in selecting CWE-306. The description explicitly mentions the absence of authentication, aligning perfectly with the characteristics of CWE-306.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-497 as a secondary candidate stems from the impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive data. However, since the primary issue is the missing authentication, CWE-306 takes precedence.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-306 being a Base CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
