## Vulnerability Description
GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 9.1.0 and prior to version 10.0.17, a technician with an access to the API can take control of an account with higher privileges. Version 10.0.17 contains a patch for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** take control of an account with higher privileges
- **attacker:** technician with access to API
- **product:** GLPI
- **version:** 9.1.0 to 10.0.16

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-47760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue within the GLPI API that allows an attacker to gain control of a higher-privileged user account. The exact nature of the API flaw isn't detailed, but the description implies it's related to how API access is controlled or how user context is handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core weakness lies in insufficient access control within the GLPI API. This allows a technician with API access to elevate their privileges and control a user account with higher permissions.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although the provided information specifies account takeover, it's tied to the idea of "higher privileges" which inherently points towards a privilege escalation issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** A technician with API access can take control of another user account with higher privileges. This allows the attacker to perform actions that the compromised user would normally be authorized to do. This can lead to complete control over the affected GLPI instance depending on the level of privileges.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** According to the provided CVSS v4 metrics, successful exploitation leads to high impact in confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is "Network," indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. This means that the attacker does not require local or physical access to the vulnerable system.
- **API Access:**  The vulnerability is accessed via the GLPI API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Technician Access:** The attacker must be a technician with access to the GLPI API. This implies that the attacker already has some level of authorized access to the system but is exploiting a flaw to elevate that access.
- **High Privileges Required:** While the attacker is a technician, the exploit allows them to effectively act as a user with higher privileges.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for exploitation. The attacker can act on their own.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI version 10.0.17.
- The provided information references CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- CVSS v4 Base Metrics are provided, detailing network attack vector, low attack complexity, required attack requirements, high privileges required, no user interaction, and high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
