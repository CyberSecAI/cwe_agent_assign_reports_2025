  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Audi Universal Traffic Recorder App 2.0. Affected is an unknown function of the component FTP Credentials. The manipulation leads to use of hard-coded password. Attacking locally is a requirement. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.89 and 2.90 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early about these issues and acted very professional. Version 2.89 is fixing this issue for new customers and 2.90 is going to fix it for existing customers.",
