  "query": "An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1.",
