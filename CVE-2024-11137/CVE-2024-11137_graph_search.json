This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-612 CWE-99 CWE-862 CWE-639 CWE-90 CWE-306 CWE-863 CWE-918",
