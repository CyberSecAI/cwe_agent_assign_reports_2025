The vulnerability is due to the **lack of proper authorization checks** in the dataset deletion endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the current user, thereby allowing any dataset to be deleted without proper authentication. This issue was fixed in version 1.2.8.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Incorrect Authorization', 'lack of proper authorization checks'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'delete any dataset', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated users', 'product': 'lunary-ai/lunary', 'version': 'up to and including 1.2.2', 'component': 'dataset deletion endpoint'}, reference_content='The provided content relates to a commit that fixes an authorization issue in the `lunary-ai/lunary` repository. The commit addresses a vulnerability related to dataset deletion.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe original code for deleting a dataset lacked proper authorization checks. It allowed deletion of a dataset based solely on the provided `id`, without verifying if the user had the required permission and if the dataset belonged to the user\\'s project.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR):** An attacker could potentially delete a dataset belonging to another user by simply knowing the dataset\\'s ID.\\n- **Missing authorization check:** The code didn\\'t verify if the user attempting the deletion had the necessary permission to perform the action.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nAn attacker could potentially delete arbitrary datasets within the application, leading to data loss and potentially disrupting the application\\'s functionality.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability could be exploited by sending a malicious DELETE request to the `/datasets/:id` endpoint with a target dataset ID.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the application.\\n- The attacker would need to know or guess the ID of the dataset they want to delete.\\n\\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\\n- The fix involves adding a check `and projectId = ${projectId}` to ensure that only datasets belonging to the user\\'s project can be deleted.\\n- The vulnerable code was located in the file `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets/index.ts`\\n- The commit message mentions \"fix: authorization delete dataset\" and references pull request #204.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    An **Incorrect Authorization** vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, which allows unauthenticated users to delete any dataset. The vulnerability is due to the **lack of proper authorization checks** in the dataset deletion endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the current user, thereby allowing any dataset to be deleted without proper authentication. This issue was fixed in version 1.2.8.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Incorrect Authorization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
