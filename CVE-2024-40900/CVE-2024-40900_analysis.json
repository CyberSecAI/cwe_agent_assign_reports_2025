The following sequence of events demonstrates the vulnerability.\n\n1. A mount operation initiates `cachefiles_ondemand_init_object` and sends a request using `cachefiles_ondemand_send_req`. A request (REQ_A) is allocated and added to the cache's request xarray. The calling thread waits for completion of the request.\n2. A daemon thread reads the request using `cachefiles_daemon_read` which calls `cachefiles_ondemand_daemon_read`. The file descriptor used for communication is closed.\n3. In another thread, `cachefiles_flush_reqs` is called. This function iterates through all requests in the cache's xarray, sets an error for each, completes the request using `complete(&req->done)`, and frees the request using `kfree(REQ_A)`.\n4. Simultaneously, another daemon thread might be trying to use the request via `cachefiles_ondemand_select_req`. Because the xarray still contains the request at this point, this code path can execute and use the request even though it has already been freed, resulting in use-after-free.\n\nThe fix is to remove the request from the xarray using `__xa_erase(xa, index)` during flushing before completing the request and freeing it, preventing access to the freed memory.",
