  "reference_content": "## CVE-2024-13926 Analysis\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2024-13926. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not properly handle input, allowing an attacker to create a post containing a large number of tags, leading to a catastrophic backtracking issue in the regular expression processing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\n*   Improper Input Validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nDenial of Service (DoS).  The vulnerability can cause high CPU usage, potentially crashing the server. The PoC shows 100% CPU core usage with concurrent requests.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An authenticated attacker (Author+) can publish a post containing a specially crafted payload with many tags.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to have Author+ privileges on the WordPress site.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   As of March 28, 2025, there is no known fix available.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Plugin:** WP-Syntax <= 1.2\n*   **CVSS:** 3.1 (Low)\n*   **Proof of Concept:** A Gist is provided with a script and payload: [https://gist.github.com/Rudloff/9d8e016a76b57ce7cee25447a4e1e0a8](https://gist.github.com/Rudloff/9d8e016a76b57ce7cee25447a4e1e0a8)\n*   **Researcher:** Pierre Rudloff\n*   **WPVDB ID:** b5f0092e-7cd5-412f-a8ea-7bd4a8bf86d2\n*   **Published Date:** 2025-03-28",
