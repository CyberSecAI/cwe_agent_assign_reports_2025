  "reference_content": "This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Openfind products. While it doesn't specify a single CVE, it details several security issues that were addressed in a security patch. One of these issues is a stack overflow vulnerability related to IMAP4, which could potentially be the one described in CVE-2024-6741 based on the CVE description placeholder.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Stack Overflow:**\n    *   **Root Cause:** A stack overflow vulnerability is present when using the IMAP4 service in Mail2000 (versions 7.0 and 8.0) under certain operations during account authorization.\n    *   **Weakness:** A buffer overflow can occur on the stack due to uncontrolled or improperly handled input while interacting with the IMAP4 service.\n    *   **Impact:** Could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other unintended consequences.\n    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, by sending specially crafted IMAP4 requests to the affected service.\n    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to interact with the IMAP4 service, and some understanding of the vulnerability to trigger it.\n*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**\n    *   **Root Cause:** A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Mail2000 (versions 7.0 and 8.0).\n    *   **Weakness:**  The web application allows for injecting malicious script into web pages.\n    *   **Impact:** Attackers can steal user cookies and session information, hijack user accounts, and potentially gain access to sensitive data.\n    *   **Attack Vector:** Injection of malicious scripts via user-provided input into the web application.\n     *   **Required Capabilities:** Attackers need to be able to inject scripts into web page, possibly by crafted emails or other web input methods.\n*   **Cookie Security:**\n    *   **Root Cause:** Cookies were not protected with the HttpOnly flag\n    *   **Weakness:** Lack of HttpOnly flag on cookies used by MailGates, MailAudit (V6.0), and Mail2000 (V7.0, V8.0) web interface.\n    *   **Impact:** Client-side scripts like Javascript can access and steal cookie values, leading to unauthorized session access and data theft.\n    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitable via XSS.\n    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to inject and run client-side script.\n\n**Affected Products and Versions:**\n\n*   MailGates V6.0\n*   MailAudit V6.0\n*   Mail2000 V7.0\n*   Mail2000 V8.0\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n*   Apply the security patches provided by Openfind.\n*   MailGates/MailAudit V6.0 should be updated to patch 6.1.7.040\n*   Mail2000 V7.0 should be updated to patch 131, and V8.0 to SP2 044.\n\nThis content provides more details than a placeholder CVE description might, specifying multiple vulnerabilities, the affected products, and the suggested mitigation steps. The stack overflow vulnerability seems to be the most likely match for CVE-2024-6741.",

The cookie **weakness** is directly called out in the CVE's details. While the vulnerability description discusses bypassing the HttpOnly flag, the root cause is the **lack** of the HttpOnly flag in the first place. There is also a potential XSS issue (CWE-79), which could be a vector for exploiting the missing HttpOnly flag, creating a chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1004\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack** of the HttpOnly flag on a sensitive cookie (CWE-1004). This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially use specific JavaScript code (likely facilitated by XSS, CWE-79) to obtain the session cookie. The impact is unauthorized session access and data theft.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which explicitly mentions the \"Lack of HttpOnly flag on cookies\". The vulnerability description also highlights that an attacker can \"obtain the session cookie with the HttpOnly flag enabled,\" which is only possible if the flag is missing in the first place. CWE-1004 is the most specific and accurate representation of this **weakness**. The retriever results also ranked CWE-1004 as the highest candidate. I'm including the XSS weakness as secondary, as this is an attack vector that allows for exploiting CWE-1004.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Rejected*: This CWE focuses on the removal of sensitive information, whereas the vulnerability focuses on the HttpOnly flag for cookies.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Rejected*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Accepted*: This CWE matches the vulnerability description, as the vulnerability is about the cookie not having the HttpOnly flag.\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Rejected*: Although related to cookie security, this is specific to the 'Secure' attribute and HTTPS sessions, while the vulnerability is about the 'HttpOnly' flag.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Rejected*: This is not about cleartext transmission;
