# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41733

## Vulnerability Description
In SAP Commerce, valid user accounts can be identified during the customer registration and login processes. This allows a potential attacker to learn if a given e-mail is used for an account, but does not grant access to any customer data beyond this knowledge. The attacker must already know the e-mail that they wish to test for. The impact on confidentiality therefore is low and no impact to integrity or availability

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper account identification**
- **impact:** availability and identify valid user accounts and integrity
- **attacker:** potential attacker
- **product:** SAP Commerce
