While there are other potentially relevant CWEs, they are either too broad or focus on the impact rather than the cause. The hierarchical relationships don't significantly influence the choice here, as the key is identifying the specific flaw in handling sensitive data before storage or transfer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper redaction of sensitive information** (CWE-212), which then leads to the **impact** of unauthorized access to user-sensitive data.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) -> Exposure of Sensitive Data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based primarily on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase, \"improved redaction of sensitive information,\" directly points to a failure to properly remove or redact sensitive data before it becomes accessible. This aligns well with CWE-212.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-212 can precede CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which accurately reflects the vulnerability's progression.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction according to MITRE mapping guidance. It is specific enough to describe the root cause (improper redaction) but not so narrow as to miss the broader context of sensitive data handling.\n\nThe evidence \"This issue was addressed with improved redaction of sensitive information\" is the basis for this selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 346.17\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 345.30\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 342.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (",
