The CSRF vulnerability leads to **Stored XSS**.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which allows an attacker to induce users into performing actions they do not intend to. In this case, the lack of CSRF protection leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79). Thus, there is a CanFollow relationship from CWE-352 to CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper CSRF protection** (CWE-352). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, leading to **Stored XSS** (CWE-79) when a user views the affected page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" and \"**Stored XSS**\". The **rootcause** is \"**improper CSRF protection**\" which allows for the injection of the **Stored XSS**.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-79 and CWE-352 as top candidates. CWE-352 is selected as the primary weakness because the description states \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" and the rootcause is \"**improper CSRF protection**\". The **Stored XSS** is a result of the CSRF vulnerability, thus CWE-79 is a secondary weakness.
