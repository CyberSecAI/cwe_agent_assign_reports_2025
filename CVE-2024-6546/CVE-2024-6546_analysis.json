  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-6546",
  "description": "The One Click Close Comments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.1. This is due to the plugin utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the \"One Click Close Comments\" WordPress plugin utilizing a test file (`bootstrap.php`) with `display_errors` set to \"on\". This configuration exposes the full server path of the web application.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the web application's full server path due to the `display_errors` setting in a test file that is publicly accessible.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The full path disclosure itself doesn't directly cause harm. However, it provides an attacker with valuable information about the server's file structure which can aid in reconnaissance and can facilitate other attacks.\n- **Aid for Further Attacks**: The revealed path can be used to target specific files/directories on the system in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.\n- **Direct Access to Test File:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `bootstrap.php` file through a web request, triggering the display of the full path information.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Special Position Required:** The attacker needs no special position or credentials. They only need to be able to send a request to the vulnerable file.\n- **Basic web request capabilities:**  The attacker requires basic web request capabilities to retrieve the content of the vulnerable file.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The Wordfence article states that the information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.\n- The vulnerable code is located in the `tests/bootstrap.php` file.\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.7.1.\n- No patch is available at the time of the Wordfence article.\n- The Wordfence article recommends uninstalling the plugin or employing mitigations based on an organization's risk tolerance.",

While CWE-615 **Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments** is a variant that describes a similar issue, the path being disclosed is not in source code comments, but in a test file that is being accessed. However, I believe the test file that is being accessed could be considered part of the application's source code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe615[\"CWE-615: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments\"]\n    \n    cwe615 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe615 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of `display_errors` being turned on in the `bootstrap.php` test file, leading to the **weakness** of **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** when the file is accessed, resulting in the impact of Full Path Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key piece of evidence is that the plugin utilizes a test file with `display_errors` on, which leads to the full path of the web application being disclosed. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-201 **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**, where sensitive information is included in data that is sent to another actor. While CWE-615 **Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments** was also considered, the path being disclosed is in a test file, not strictly in source code comments.
