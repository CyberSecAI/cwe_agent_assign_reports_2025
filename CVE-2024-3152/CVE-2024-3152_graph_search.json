An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/slug/thread/threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collectors `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the applications failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-306 CWE-1427 CWE-352 CWE-269 CWE-285 CWE-20 CWE-918",
