# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38616

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi carl9170 re-fix fortified-memset warning The carl9170_tx_release() function sometimes triggers a fortified-memset warning in my randconfig builds In file included from include/linux/string.h254, from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c40 In function fortify_memset_chk, inlined from carl9170_tx_release at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c2832, inlined from kref_put at include/linux/kref.h653, inlined from carl9170_tx_put_skb at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c3429 include/linux/fortify-string.h49325 error call to __write_overflow_field declared with attribute warning detected **write beyond size of field** (1st parameter) maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning] 493 | __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size) Kees previously tried to avoid this by using memset_after(), but it seems this does not fully address the problem. I noticed that the memset_after() here is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original cast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler. Unfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[] because that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not get struct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls on the two members does address the warning though.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper use of memset_after() function**
- **weakness:** **write beyond size of field**
- **product:** Linux kernel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a fix for a fortified-memset warning in the `carl9170_tx_release()` function within the Linux kernel's wifi driver for the carl9170. This is not a vulnerability, but a compiler warning which can be an indicator of potential issues.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
The `carl9170_tx_release()` function was using `memset_after()` to clear a portion of the `txinfo` structure. However, the `memset_after()` was operating on the `status` member of a union, while the intended target was related to `rate_driver_data`.  This mismatch, along with the use of anonymous structs, triggered a `fortified-memset` compiler warning, indicating a potential buffer overflow issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The primary issue is not a vulnerability but a compiler warning (-Werror=attribute-warning) which is raised by the `fortify_memset_chk` function. The warning indicates a potential write beyond the intended size, which could lead to memory corruption under certain circumstances. 
- Using `memset_after` on a different part of a union than intended, and confusion with anonymous structs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The described scenario is not an exploitable vulnerability but can lead to undefined behavior if the compiler warning was indicative of a real memory corruption. 
-  In the case, it was a false alarm (as in, not exploitable memory corruption), and the fix is to prevent the compiler warning.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  There is no known attack vector for a malicious actor to exploit this issue. The issue is not an exploitable vulnerability but rather a compiler warning being generated due to incorrect usage of memory clearing functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Not applicable since it's not an exploitable vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE:**
The provided commit logs and code diffs offer far greater detail than a typical CVE description would, explaining the precise cause of the compiler warning, the failed attempts to address it, and the final solution. It details how `memset_after()` was used incorrectly and why it triggered the warning and provides the corrected code changes using two memset calls on the right fields within the struct.
