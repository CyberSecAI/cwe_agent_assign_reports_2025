# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9887

## Vulnerability Description
The Login using WordPress Users ( WP as SAML IDP ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9887:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9887
*   **Description:** The "Login using WordPress Users (WP as SAML IDP)" plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.15.6
*   **Patched Version:** 1.15.7

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 'id' parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   The plugin does not use prepared statements, leading to direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not utilize prepared statements, which are a standard method to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and potentially other sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, a successful SQL injection could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the 'id' parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level privileges or higher to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and how to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `sso-idp-settings.php` controller file in the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.15.7 by improving the security of the SQL queries executed by the plugin. Specifically, the changes in `MoDbQueries.php` indicate a switch from direct string concatenation to using `$wpdb->prepare` which helps mitigate SQL Injection.
*   The Wordfence report categorizes this as a time-based SQL Injection.
