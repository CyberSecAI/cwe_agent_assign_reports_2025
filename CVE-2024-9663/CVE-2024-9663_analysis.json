Since the description explicitly mentions XSS, CWE-79 is a better fit.\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of input, not missing authorization checks.\n- CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - This CWE is specific to SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are not mentioned or implied in the vulnerability description.\n- CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of input, not unrestricted file uploads.\n- CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements - This CWE is a Class-level CWE and is less specific than CWE-79.\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of input, not incorrect authorization checks.\n- CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection') - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of input, not static code injection.\n- CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of input, not modification of immutable data.",
