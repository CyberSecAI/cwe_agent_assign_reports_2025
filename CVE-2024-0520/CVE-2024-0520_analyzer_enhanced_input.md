# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow version 8.2.1 allows for remote code execution due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command (Command Injection) within the `mlflow.data.http_dataset_source.py` module. Specifically, when loading a dataset from a source URL with an HTTP scheme, the filename extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header or the URL path is used to generate the final file path without proper sanitization. This flaw enables an attacker to control the file path fully by utilizing **path traversal** or absolute path techniques, such as ../../tmp/poc.txt or /tmp/poc.txt, leading to arbitrary file write. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to execute commands on the vulnerable machine, potentially gaining access to data and model information. The issue is fixed in version 2.9.0.
