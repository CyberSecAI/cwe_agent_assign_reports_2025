CWE-770 is a more specific case of CWE-400, and the vulnerability description aligns with CWE-770 because it explicitly mentions a memory allocation issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to adequately verify the outcome of memory allocation** (CWE-770), which leads to excessive resource consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n  - Root Cause: **Fails to adequately verify the outcome of memory allocation** while processing Type 18 messages.\n  - Weakness: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770).\n  - Impact: Denial-of-Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the software **fails to adequately verify the outcome of memory allocation while processing Type 18 messages**. This statement aligns strongly with CWE-770, which addresses the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. The provided evidence directly supports this classification, and the retriever results also list CWE-770 as a top candidate. While CWE-400 is a broader category, CWE-770 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating that it is a more specific type of uncontrolled resource consumption. This further supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is based on the provided evidence and is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
