# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10327

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing the authentication to proceed regardless of the users selection. When a user long-presses the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to succeed. The ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include * When a user is presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly and selects their reply without unlocking the device * When a user is presented with a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply * When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification. A pre-condition for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **vector:** push notification responses and long-press notification banner and select an option
- **product:** Okta Verify for iOS
- **version:** 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10327:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Okta Verify for iOS handles push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature. Specifically, when a user interacts with a push notification via long-press or dragging (without unlocking the device), the authentication process proceeds regardless of whether the user selects "Approve" or "Deny." This effectively bypasses the intended user decision.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the user's response to the push notification when using the ContextExtension. The application does not correctly interpret the user's selection from the notification options.
*   **Bypass of MFA:** By ignoring the user's choice, an attacker can potentially bypass the MFA process, gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.
*   **Compromise of Accounts:** With the ability to bypass MFA, an attacker can potentially compromise user accounts, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and other malicious activities.
*  **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The vulnerability circumvents the security measures put in place by Okta's multi-factor authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Push Notification Manipulation:** The attacker triggers a push notification to the targeted user's iOS device.
*   **ContextExtension Abuse:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in how Okta Verify handles the response from the iOS ContextExtension feature of the push notification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initiate MFA challenge:** The attacker needs to trigger an authentication attempt that requires Okta Verify push notification. This implies knowledge of the user's credentials or a method to initiate an authentication flow (such as a stolen session token)
*   **No device access needed:** The attacker does not need access to the victim's device itself. The attack leverages the push notification mechanism and its associated context extension.
*  **User interaction (limited):** The user must receive a push notification and interact with it by long-pressing or dragging it down to see the available options, but the user's actual choice is ignored.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Precondition:** The vulnerability affects users who enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic.
*   **Affected Versions:**  Specifically, Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta and the released version) were affected.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability has been fixed in version 9.27.2 and later. Affected users were prevented from authenticating from vulnerable versions, indicating a server-side block.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.1, categorized as high severity.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
