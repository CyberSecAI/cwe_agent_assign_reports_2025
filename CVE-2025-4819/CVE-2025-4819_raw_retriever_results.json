Affected is an unknown function of the file /monitor/online/batchForceLogout of the component Offline Logout. The manipulation of the argument ids leads to improper authorization. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
