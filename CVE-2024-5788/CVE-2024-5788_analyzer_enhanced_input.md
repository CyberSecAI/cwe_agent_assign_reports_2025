## Vulnerability Description
The Silesia theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the link attribute within the themes Button shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'button' shortcode of the Silesia WordPress theme. Specifically, the `link` attribute is not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `link` attribute of the `[button]` shortcode. This code is then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views a page containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Account takeover (if an admin is targeted)
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information such as session cookies
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `[button]` shortcode by setting a malicious value in the `link` attribute, e.g., `[button link="javascript:alert('XSS')"]Button Text[/button]`.
*   The injected code is stored in the WordPress database along with the page content.
*   When the page with the shortcode is loaded, the malicious script executes in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have Contributor-level access or higher within the WordPress site. This access level is needed to create or modify posts/pages with shortcodes.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `button_shortcode` function in the `functions/shortcodes.php` file of the Silesia theme.
*   The `esc_attr()` function is used on the `link` attribute, but this function is intended for HTML attributes and doesn't prevent the execution of javascript URIs.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Silesia theme up to and including 1.0.6.
*   There is no known patch available.
*   The Wordfence article recommends uninstalling the theme until a fix is released.
