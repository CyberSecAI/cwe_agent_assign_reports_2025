  "description": "A security flaw has been discovered in Solvait version 24.4.2 that allows an attacker to elevate their privileges. By manipulating the Request ID and Action Type parameters in /AssignToMe/SetAction, an attacker can bypass approval workflows leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or approval of fraudulent requests.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an **Improper Access Control** in the `SetAction` endpoint of the Solvait application, specifically related to leave requests. The application doesn't properly validate if a user is authorized to change the status of a leave request, allowing manipulation of request IDs and action types.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly reference and manipulate the approval status of any leave request by knowing its Request ID. The application does not properly verify that the user is authorized to modify the request.\n*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system lacks proper checks to ensure that only managers can approve or change the status of leave requests.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges by approving their own leave requests or any other user's requests, bypassing the intended approval process.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may gain unauthorized access to resources or approvals, potentially leading to fraudulent activities.\n*   **Compromised Integrity:** The vulnerability compromises the integrity of the approval process, undermining trust in the system's security.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/AssignToMe/SetAction` endpoint, manipulating parameters like `ReqNum`, `RequestId`, and `ActionTypeRequest`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a regular employee with a valid account in the Solvait system to initiate a leave request and obtain a request ID.\n*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the structure of the vulnerable request parameters and the endpoint URL.\n*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to use tools to craft and send POST requests, such as cURL, Postman, or a browser\u2019s developer tools.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was tested on version 24.4.2 of Solvait.\n*   The specific endpoint affected is `https://<domain>/AssignToMe/SetAction`.\n*   The parameters susceptible to manipulation are: `ReqNum`, `TableName`, `ActionTypeRequest`, `Comment`, `RequestId`, `WordkerId`, and `DelegateUserId`.\n* The attack involves crafting a POST request to `/AssignToMe/SetAction` with the manipulated parameters to force an approval of the request.\n\nThis content provides more details than what's typically available in a standard CVE description.",

CWE-639, \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key,\" is a related weakness as the user-controlled \"Request ID\" and \"Action Type\" parameters are used to bypass authorization. CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization,\" is also related but more general, as it encompasses cases where authorization checks are missing or incorrect. Since the vulnerability involves a flawed authorization check relying on modifiable inputs, CWE-863 is the most specific and appropriate choice, with CWE-639 adding further context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe285 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** logic (CWE-863) in the `SetAction` endpoint. This allows an attacker to **bypass authorization** (CWE-639) by manipulating the Request ID and Action Type parameters. The impact of this is **unauthorized access** to sensitive information and the ability to approve fraudulent requests, effectively leading to privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly relies on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states, \"The root cause is an **Improper Access Control** in the `SetAction` endpoint... The application doesn't properly validate if a user is authorized to change the status of a leave request, allowing manipulation of request IDs and action types.\"\n\nThe relationship graph helped to visualize the connection between the different CWEs and choose the most specific one. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is the most accurate because it describes the fundamental flaw in the authorization process. The other CWEs are related but represent either a broader category (CWE-285) or a specific mechanism of exploitation (CWE-639).\n\nCWE-863 is at the Class level, and while the retriever suggested some Base level CWEs, the evidence strongly suggests that the authorization logic is present but flawed, making CWE-863 the most accurate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not apply, because the vulnerability is not about assigning the wrong privileges initially, but about bypassing the authorization to elevate privileges.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not apply because the issue is not about a privilege being defined with unsafe actions, but about the **incorrect authorization** that allows bypassing privilege requirements.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
