# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45919

## Vulnerability Description
A security flaw has been discovered in Solvait version 24.4.2 that allows an attacker to elevate their privileges. By manipulating the Request ID and Action Type parameters in /AssignToMe/SetAction, an attacker can bypass approval workflows leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or approval of fraudulent requests.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unauthorized access to sensitive information or approval of fraudulent requests
- **vector:** manipulating Request ID and Action Type parameters in /AssignToMe/SetAction
- **product:** Solvait
- **version:** 24.4.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an **Improper Access Control** in the `SetAction` endpoint of the Solvait application, specifically related to leave requests. The application doesn't properly validate if a user is authorized to change the status of a leave request, allowing manipulation of request IDs and action types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly reference and manipulate the approval status of any leave request by knowing its Request ID. The application does not properly verify that the user is authorized to modify the request.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system lacks proper checks to ensure that only managers can approve or change the status of leave requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges by approving their own leave requests or any other user's requests, bypassing the intended approval process.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may gain unauthorized access to resources or approvals, potentially leading to fraudulent activities.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** The vulnerability compromises the integrity of the approval process, undermining trust in the system's security.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/AssignToMe/SetAction` endpoint, manipulating parameters like `ReqNum`, `RequestId`, and `ActionTypeRequest`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a regular employee with a valid account in the Solvait system to initiate a leave request and obtain a request ID.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the structure of the vulnerable request parameters and the endpoint URL.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to use tools to craft and send POST requests, such as cURL, Postman, or a browser’s developer tools.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested on version 24.4.2 of Solvait.
*   The specific endpoint affected is `https://<domain>/AssignToMe/SetAction`.
*   The parameters susceptible to manipulation are: `ReqNum`, `TableName`, `ActionTypeRequest`, `Comment`, `RequestId`, `WordkerId`, and `DelegateUserId`.
* The attack involves crafting a POST request to `/AssignToMe/SetAction` with the manipulated parameters to force an approval of the request.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
