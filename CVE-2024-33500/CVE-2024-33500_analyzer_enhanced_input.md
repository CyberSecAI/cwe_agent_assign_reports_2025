## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 10 (All versions = V9.3.0 < V9.24.22). Affected applications could allow users with the capability to manage a role to elevate the access rights of users with that role. Successful exploitation requires to guess the id of a target role which contains the elevated access rights.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** elevate access rights of users with that role
- **vector:** guessing the id of a target role
- **attacker:** users with the capability to manage a role
- **product:** Mendix Applications
- **version:** 9.3.0 < V9.24.22

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper Privilege Management

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The Mendix Runtime allows users with role management capabilities to elevate access rights of other users within that role. This occurs because the system doesn't properly restrict role modifications and the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on role manipulation.
*   Specifically, a user with the ability to manage a role can modify that role to include higher privileges than initially intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with role management privileges can escalate their own or other users' access rights within that role to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity:** The confidentiality and integrity of the application data can be compromised due to this escalated access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Role Modification:** The attacker must modify the target role to grant elevated privileges.
*   **Role ID Guessing:**  The attacker needs to guess the ID of the role they intend to target, which requires the attacker to have some level of knowledge of the application configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **High Privileges (PR:H):** The attacker must have the capability to manage roles within the Mendix application. This implies the attacker already has an authenticated high-privilege account within the application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Configuration:**  Some level of knowledge of the application configuration and roles is needed in order to guess the target role ID.
*   **No User Interaction (UI:N):**  No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.9 and a CVSS v4.0 score of 7.4, indicating a moderate to high severity.
*   The vulnerability is present in Mendix Runtime versions 9.3.0 to before 9.24.22, all versions before 10.11.0, and all versions before 10.6.9.
*   Siemens provides a mitigation, which is to set `StrictReferenceChecks` to false, but it is noted that this will reduce the security of reference checks.
