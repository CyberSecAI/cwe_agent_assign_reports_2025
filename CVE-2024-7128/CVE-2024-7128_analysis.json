  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-7128",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the OpenShift console. Several endpoints in the application use the authHandler() and authHandlerWithUser() middleware functions. When the default authentication provider (openShiftAuth) is set, these functions do not perform any authentication checks, relying instead on the targeted service to handle authentication and authorization. This issue leads to various degrees of data exposure due to a lack of proper credential verification.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7128:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of authentication checks within the `authHandler()` and `authHandlerWithUser()` middleware functions in the OpenShift console.\n*   When the default authentication provider (\"openShiftAuth\") is active, these middleware functions fail to perform any authentication checks. Instead, they rely on the targeted service to handle authentication and authorization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper credential verification within the middleware functions. This allows unauthenticated users to bypass intended security checks.\n*   **Data Exposure:** Due to the lack of authentication, multiple endpoints become vulnerable to data exposure.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Data Access:** Exploitation allows unauthenticated users to access potentially sensitive data exposed through the vulnerable endpoints. The exact degree of data exposure varies depending on the specific endpoint.\n*   The severity is rated as \"medium\".\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to access the vulnerable endpoints when default authentication provider is enabled.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need network connectivity to the OpenShift console to send requests to the vulnerable endpoints.\n*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated users.\n\n**Vulnerable endpoints:**\n\nThe following endpoints are specifically listed as vulnerable:\n\n*   `/api/console/monitoring-dashboard-config`\n*   `/api/console/knative-event-sources`\n*   `/api/console/knative-channels`\n*   `/api/check-updates`\n*   `/api/console/version`\n*   `/api/copy-login-commands`\n*   `/api/gitops`\n*   `/api/plugins/`\n*   `/api/metrics`\n*   `/api/metrics/usage`",

Since the vulnerability description explicitly states a **lack of authentication checks**, CWE-306 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than its parent, CWE-287. Additionally, the guidance provided emphasizes choosing CWE-306 when no login is required.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe204\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication checks** (CWE-306), which directly leads to **data exposure**. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly detail how this data exposure is manifested, it can potentially lead to observable response discrepancies (CWE-204).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The key phrase \"lack of authentication checks\" points directly to CWE-306, which is also supported by the MITRE guidance.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-306, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **missing authentication** for critical functions.
