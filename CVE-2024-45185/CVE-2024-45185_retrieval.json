While the specific consequences are not detailed in the provided text, heap overflows often lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability lies within the GPRS protocol, indicating that network-based attacks might be possible.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- An attacker would likely need to have a
