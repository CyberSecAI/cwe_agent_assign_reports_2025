While other CWEs were considered, none as closely matched the identified **SQL Injection** vulnerability stemming from improper neutralization of special elements in the `course_id` parameter. The hierarchical relationships were not directly relevant as CWE-89 is already a Base-level CWE, the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `course_id` parameter leading directly to **SQL Injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the evidence provided, specifically:\n\n*   The **Vulnerability Description** clearly states \"**sql injection**\" resulting from the manipulation of the `course_id` argument.\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly mentions that the root cause is the direct use of the `course_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleansing or validation, directly resulting in an **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n*   The **Retriever Results** list CWE-89 as the top match with a score of 1.0.\n\nThis evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-89 as the primary weakness.
