  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udp Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port(). syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux(). In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcount of the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb->destructor, so we check SOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU grace period. Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being put into the hash table. Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too early in udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small race window CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- udp_v4_early_demux() udp_lib_get_port() | |- hlist_add_head_rcu() |- sk = __udp4_lib_demux_lookup() | |- DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(sk_is_refcounted(sk)) `- sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_RCU_FREE) We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b (net set SOCK_RCU_FREE before inserting socket into hashtable). Lets apply the same fix for UDP.
