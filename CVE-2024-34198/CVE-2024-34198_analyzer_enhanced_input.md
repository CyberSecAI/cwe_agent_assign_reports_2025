# Vulnerability Description

    TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002RU V2.1.1-B20230720.1011 is vulnerable to **Buffer Overflow**. The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program **fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input**. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a **stack overflow**. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.
