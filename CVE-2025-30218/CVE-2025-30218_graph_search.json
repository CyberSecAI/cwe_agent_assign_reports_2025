To mitigate CVE-2025-29927, Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6, 13.5.10, 14.2.26, and 15.2.4. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-201 CWE-444 CWE-212 CWE-598 CWE-1390 CWE-770 CWE-1385 CWE-319 CWE-918",
