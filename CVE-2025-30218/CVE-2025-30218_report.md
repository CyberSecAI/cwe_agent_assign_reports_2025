# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-30218

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30218

## Description

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. To mitigate CVE-2025-29927, Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6, 13.5.10, 14.2.26, and 15.2.4.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** validated x-middleware-subrequest-id persisting across multiple incoming requests
- **Impact:** send subrequest ID to third party
- **Product:** Next.js

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship between higher-level classes and the more specific base CWEs. CWE-201 and CWE-212 are both base-level CWEs that directly reflect the specific **weakness** described in the vulnerability. While other CWEs were considered, they were either too abstract or did not precisely capture the nature of the information leakage.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of persisting and **validating `x-middleware-subrequest-id` across multiple incoming requests**, which leads to the unintended consequence of sending this subrequest ID to third parties.

`Improper Validation of Subrequest ID` -> `Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)` -> `Information Leakage to Third Party`

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which involves the unintended transmission of the `x-middleware-subrequest-id` to third-party hosts. The `x-middleware-subrequest-id` is sent to all requests, even those destined for hosts different from the Next.js application because the subrequest ID is set globally and included in headers for all outgoing requests within Middleware.

The retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer). CWE-201 was selected as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the core issue of sensitive information being included in data sent to an unintended recipient. The vulnerability description clearly states that the `x-middleware-subrequest-id` is sent to third parties, which aligns with the definition of CWE-201.

CWE-212 was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability could also be viewed as a failure to remove the sensitive `x-middleware-subrequest-id` before transmitting the request. However, the primary issue is the insertion of this ID into the request in the first place.

The relationship analysis and mapping guidance support the selection of CWE-201 as the primary CWE. It is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the **rootcause** of vulnerabilities. The usage is allowed, and the rationale aligns with the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
