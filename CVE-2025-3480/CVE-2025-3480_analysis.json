The vulnerability description states \"The issue results from the **lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials\". |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate.

CWE-319 is a more specific Base CWE, while CWE-200 is a more general Class CWE. The vulnerability description strongly suggests the **lack of encryption**, making CWE-319 the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials (CWE-319), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states the **lack of encryption** as the root cause, making CWE-319 the most appropriate choice.
