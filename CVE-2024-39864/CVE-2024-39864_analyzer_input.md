# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39864

## Vulnerability Description
The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for testing purposes. By default, the integration API service port is disabled and is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative. Due to an **improper initialisation logic**, the integration API service would listen on a random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure. Users are recommended to restrict the network access on the CloudStack management server hosts to only essential ports. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper initialisation logic**

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-39864:

**Root Cause:**

*   The CloudStack integration API service, when disabled (i.e., `integration.api.port` set to 0), incorrectly initializes and listens on a random port instead of remaining completely disabled. This is due to improper initialization logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Port Exposure:**  The primary vulnerability is that a supposedly disabled service (the integration API) becomes active on a randomly assigned port.
*   **Unauthenticated API Access:** The integration API service, even when enabled intentionally, operates without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions:** An attacker who discovers the randomized port can access the unauthenticated API service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Exploitation can allow the attacker to perform unauthorized administrative actions, which may lead to remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can result in a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CloudStack managed infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the CloudStack management network to perform a port scan and find the random port used by the disabled integration API.
*   **Port Scanning:** The attacker must actively scan the network to discover the randomly assigned port, since it is not a default/expected port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to Management Network:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the CloudStack management network.
*   **Network Scanning Capabilities:** The attacker needs the capability to perform network scans to find the open port where the API is exposed.
*   **Knowledge of CloudStack API:** Understanding of the API endpoints is needed to perform malicious actions.
