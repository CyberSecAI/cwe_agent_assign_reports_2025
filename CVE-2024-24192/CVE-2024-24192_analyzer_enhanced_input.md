## Vulnerability Description
robdns commit d76d2e6 was discovered to contain a **heap overflow** via the component block->filename at /src/zonefile-insertion.c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **product:** robdns
- **version:** commit d76d2e6
- **component:** block->filename at /src/zonefile-insertion.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `zonefile-insertion.c` file of the `robdns` project.
- The vulnerability stems from a `memcpy` operation where the size of the destination buffer (`block->filename`) can be smaller than the size of the source buffer (`parser->src.filename`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to unchecked sizes in memcpy operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The `memcpy` operation writes past the boundary of the `block->filename` buffer, leading to heap corruption.
- This heap corruption could result in a denial of service (crash) or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, although the provided content does not explicitly state code execution.
- The comment by the reporter also mentions leaking heap information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is by crafting a zone file such that the `parser->src.filename` is larger than `block->filename`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the input zonefile. The attacker would need to control the `parser->src.filename` to be larger than `block->filename`.
