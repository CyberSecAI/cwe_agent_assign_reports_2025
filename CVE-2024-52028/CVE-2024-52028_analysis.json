The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top combined result. CWE-119 is a broader category encompassing buffer overflows, while CWE-787 describes the mechanics of writing outside the intended buffer bounds. The final decision leans towards CWE-121 as the most specific and relevant CWE based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.28\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe software performs an operation that attempts to read or write data to a memory buffer, but it does not properly restrict the operation within the bounds of that buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: N/A\n- Rationale: N/A\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-120\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-122\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-123\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-125\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-126\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-127\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-128\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-129\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-130\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-131\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-132\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-133\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-134\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-135\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-136\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-137\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-138\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-139\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-140\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-141\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-142\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-143\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-144\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-145\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-146\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-147\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-148\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-149\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-150\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-151\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-152\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-153\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-154\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-155\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-156\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-157\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-158\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-159\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-160\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-161\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-162\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-163\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-164\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-165\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-166\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-167\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-168\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-169\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-170\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-171\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-172\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-173\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-174\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-175\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-176\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-177\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-178\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-179\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-180\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-181\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-182\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-183\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-184\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-185\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-186\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-187\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-188\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-189\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-190\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-191\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-192\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-193\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-194\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-195\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-196\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-197\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-198\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-199\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-200\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-201\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-202\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-203\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-204\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-205\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-206\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-207\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-208\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-209\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-210\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-211\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-212\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-213\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-214\n- PARENTOF",

The final decision leans towards CWE-121 as the most specific and relevant CWE based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.28\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe software performs an operation that attempts to read or write data to a memory buffer, but it does not properly restrict the operation within the bounds of that buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: N/A\n- Rationale: N/A\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-120\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-122\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-123\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-125\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-126\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-127\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-128\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-129\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-130\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-131\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-132\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-133\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-134\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-135\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-136\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-137\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-138\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-139\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-140\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-141\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-142\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-143\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-144\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-145\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-146\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-147\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-148\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-149\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-150\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-151\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-152\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-153\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-154\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-155\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-156\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-157\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-158\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-159\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-160\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-161\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-162\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-163\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-164\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-165\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-166\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-167\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-168\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-169\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-170\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-171\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-172\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-173\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-174\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-175\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-176\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-177\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-178\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-179\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-180\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-181\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-182\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-183\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-184\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-185\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-186\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-187\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-188\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-189\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-190\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-191\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-192\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-193\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-194\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-195\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-196\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-197\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-198\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-199\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-200\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-201\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-202\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-203\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-204\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-205\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-206\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-207\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-208\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-209\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-210\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-211\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-212\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-213\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-214\n- PARENTOF\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-125:**\n- 125 (Out-of-bounds Read) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-180:**\n- 180 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Canonicalize) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
