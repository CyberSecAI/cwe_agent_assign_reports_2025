Permissions for creating and deleting languages have already existed and could be configured, but were not enforced by Kirbys frontend or backend code. A permission for updating existing languages has not existed before the patched versions. So disabling the languages.* wildcard permission for a role could not have prohibited updates to existing language definitions. The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to manipulate the language definitions.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1336 CWE-862 CWE-209 CWE-184 CWE-352 CWE-285 CWE-863",
