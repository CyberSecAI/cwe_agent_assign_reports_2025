# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-20405

# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored **XSS** attack by exploiting an RFI vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.
