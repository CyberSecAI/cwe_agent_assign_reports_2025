This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['insufficient input validation', 'insufficient validation of user-supplied input'], 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface', 'vector': 'persuading a user to click a crafted link', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated remote attacker', 'product': 'Cisco Finesse', 'version': '', 'component': 'web-based management interface'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of CVE-2024-20405:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- Insufficient validation of user-supplied input within specific HTTP requests sent to the affected Cisco Finesse device. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious code.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The vulnerability stems from the ability to include files from a remote location. The provided document does not specify how the file inclusion occurs, but it does mention that it is a prerequisite for XSS.\\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the RFI vulnerability, an attacker can inject and store malicious scripts within the affected system.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected interface.\\n- **Sensitive Information Access:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive information stored on the affected device.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Crafted Link:** The attacker can persuade a user to click a crafted link, which then triggers the RFI vulnerability and injects the malicious XSS code into the system.\\n- **Unauthenticated, Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely by an unauthenticated user.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link.\\n- The attacker needs to be able to get a user to click this crafted link, meaning that some social engineering is required.\\n- No authentication is required.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The document mentions that this vulnerability is not dependent on CVE-2024-20404.\\n- The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is Medium.\\n- The CVSS base score is 4.8 with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device.
