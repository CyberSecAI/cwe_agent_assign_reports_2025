  "description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.4, an account takeover vulnerability exists due to the exposure of password recovery tokens in API responses. Specifically, when a user initiates the password reset process, the recovery token is included in the response of the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint, which lists all users in a team. This allows any authenticated user to capture the recovery token of another user and subsequently change that users password without consent, effectively taking over the account. The issue lies in the inclusion of the `recovery_token` attribute in the users object returned by the API.",

The secondary weakness, CWE-200, arises because the recovery token, which should be confidential, is exposed in the API response. While CWE-200 is a Class, it's useful for highlighting the exposure aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unverified password change** (CWE-620) due to the exposure of the recovery token. This leads to account takeover, which is the impact. The exposure of the token itself is an instance of sensitive information exposure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-620 as the primary weakness due to the **unverified password change**. This is because the core issue is the ability to change another user's password without proper verification, facilitated by the exposed recovery token. CWE-200 is a secondary weakness as it highlights the information exposure aspect.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that \"when a user initiates the password reset process, the recovery token is included in the response of the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint, which lists all users in a team. This allows any authenticated user to capture the recovery token of another user and subsequently change that users password without consent, effectively taking over the account.\"\n\nCWE-620 is a Base-level CWE and is preferred. CWE-200, while a Class-level CWE, is included to highlight the exposure aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant
