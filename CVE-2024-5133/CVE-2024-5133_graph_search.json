Specifically, when a user initiates the password reset process, the recovery token is included in the response of the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint, which lists all users in a team. This allows any authenticated user to capture the recovery token of another user and subsequently change that users password without consent, effectively taking over the account. The issue lies in the inclusion of the `recovery_token` attribute in the users object returned by the API. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-620 CWE-201 CWE-200 CWE-640 CWE-639 CWE-549 CWE-287 CWE-90 CWE-257 CWE-863",
