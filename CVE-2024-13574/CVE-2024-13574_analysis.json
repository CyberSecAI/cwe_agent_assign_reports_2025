It details a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the XV Random Quotes plugin for WordPress. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe XSS vulnerability could be used against high privilege users such as administrators.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A crafted URL can be used to trigger the XSS. Example: `http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=stray_manage&qo=1\"></script><script>alert(1)</script><script>`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (potentially an administrator) into clicking it. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No known fix is currently available as of the provided information.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)\n*   **Researcher:** Hassan Khan Yusufzai - Splint3r7\n*   **WPVDB ID:** 7eb9ef20-5d34-425e-b7fc-38a769d0a822\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published on 2025-02-18.\n*   **Affected Plugin:** XV Random Quotes <= 1.40\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79",
