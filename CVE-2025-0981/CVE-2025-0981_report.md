# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0981

## Description

A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to hijack a users session by exploiting a **Stored Cross Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability in the Group Editor page. This allows admin users to inject malicious JavaScript in the description field, which captures the session cookie of authenticated users. The cookie can then be sent to an external server, enabling session hijacking. It can also lead to information disclosure, as exposed session cookies can be used to impersonate users and gain unauthorised access to sensitive information.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** Stored Cross Site Scripting
- **Impact:** ['inject malicious JavaScript', 'hijack a users session', 'information disclosure', 'impersonate users', 'session hijacking']
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** ChurchCRM
- **Version:** 5.13.0 and prior
- **Component:** Group Editor page

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes** user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. |
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-79 is the root cause, where user-controlled input is not properly neutralized, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into web pages. CWE-1004 is included because the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary mentioned the ability of the attacker to steal the session cookie which is missing the HttpOnly flag. CWE-79 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-1004 is a variant, which is also a preferred level of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in the Group Editor page. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the description field. When a user views the group details, the script executes, allowing the attacker to capture the user's session cookie. The session cookie is vulnerable because it is a Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag (CWE-1004). This enables session hijacking and information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment correctly identified CWE-79 as the primary weakness, as the root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper neutralization of input** leading to XSS. The CVE reference summary supports this, stating "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Group Editor page of ChurchCRM."
The retriever results also strongly support CWE-79, with a high similarity score.

CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) is added as a secondary concern because the stolen cookie lacks the HttpOnly flag, making session hijacking easier. The CVE reference summary mentioned the need to "Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies," pointing to this weakness.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): While CSRF is a web application vulnerability, it does not directly relate to the **stored XSS** issue described.
*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.
*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): While related to XSS, CWE-79 is more specific as it directly addresses the **improper neutralization of input during web page generation**.
*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): This is not relevant as it is related to authorization issues.
