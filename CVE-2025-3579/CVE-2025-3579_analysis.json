The vulnerability stems from **Prompt Injection** attacks through the `/api/<string-chat>/message` endpoint, specifically manipulating the \u2018content\u2019 parameter. |\n| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. An authenticated malicious user can execute unauthorized commands within the system due to an **open registry**, including executing operating system (Unix) commands, interacting with internal services (PHP, MySQL), and invoking native framework functions (Laravel, Symfony). The underlying weakness is improper input validation and sanitization within the LLM chatbot, allowing for code injection via crafted prompts.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1427, which represents the **improper neutralization** of input used for LLM prompting. A secondary CWE is CWE-94, which represents **improper control of code generation** leading to code injection. CWE-1427 is related to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-94 can follow CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program) and is a child of CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe1427 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe77,cwe913 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Prompt Injection (CWE-1427)**, due to an **open registry**, allowing a malicious user to inject commands into the LLM. This leads to the execution of unauthorized commands (CWE-94) within the system, including OS commands, interactions with internal services, and invocation of native framework functions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-1427 because the vulnerability stems from the ability to inject prompts into the LLM, leading to the execution of unauthorized commands. The evidence supporting this is the vulnerability description which mentions **Prompt Injection** attacks through the `/api/<string-chat>/message` endpoint, specifically manipulating the \u2018content\u2019 parameter.
