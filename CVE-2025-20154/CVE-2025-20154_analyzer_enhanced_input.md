## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) server feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. For Cisco IOS XR Software, this vulnerability could cause the ipsla_ippm_server&nbspprocess to reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled. This vulnerability is due to **out-of-bounds array access** when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note For Cisco IOS XR Software, only the ipsla_ippm_server process reloads unexpectedly and only when debugs are enabled. The vulnerability details for Cisco IOS XR Software are as follows&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSecurity Impact Rating (SIR) Low&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCVSS Base Score 3.7&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCVSS Vector CVSS3.1/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIN/SU/CN/IN/AL

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-20154 based on provided content:

This content **is relevant** to CVE-2025-20154. It provides a detailed security advisory from Cisco regarding a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in TWAMP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Out-of-bounds array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from processing malformed TWAMP control packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
*   For Cisco IOS XR Software, the `ipsla_ippm_server` process can reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device.
*   Network-based (remote).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated.
*   Remote access to the network.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
*   No workarounds are available.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software (with TWAMP server feature enabled).
*   **Specific conditions for IOS XE and IOS XR:** The vulnerability in IOS XE only affects releases 16.6.1 through 17.2.3 if the debug command `debug ip sla trace twamp connection` is active. All other releases do not require debugs to be enabled. For IOS XR, the vulnerability only affects devices with the `debug ipsla trace twamp connection` command enabled.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base Score: 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
*   **Cisco Bug IDs:** CSCve33776, CSCwk80897, CSCwm63229
*   The advisory includes instructions on how to determine if the TWAMP server is enabled and if debugs are active on affected devices.
*   Due to the nature of the fix, Cisco is unable to develop an SMU for IOS XR and a software upgrade is required.
*   The advisory is part of a larger bundled publication for May 2025.
*   The advisory states that the PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
