For Cisco IOS XR Software, this vulnerability could cause the ipsla_ippm_server&nbspprocess to reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled. This vulnerability is due to out-of-bounds array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
