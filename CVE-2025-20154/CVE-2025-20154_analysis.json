  "description": "A vulnerability in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) server feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. For Cisco IOS XR Software, this vulnerability could cause the ipsla_ippm_server&nbspprocess to reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled. This vulnerability is due to **out-of-bounds array access** when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note For Cisco IOS XR Software, only the ipsla_ippm_server process reloads unexpectedly and only when debugs are enabled.

It provides a detailed security advisory from Cisco regarding a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in TWAMP.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Out-of-bounds array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from processing malformed TWAMP control packets.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n*   For Cisco IOS XR Software, the `ipsla_ippm_server` process can reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device.\n*   Network-based (remote).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated.\n*   Remote access to the network.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\n*   No workarounds are available.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Products:** Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software (with TWAMP server feature enabled).\n*   **Specific conditions for IOS XE and IOS XR:** The vulnerability in IOS XE only affects releases 16.6.1 through 17.2.3 if the debug command `debug ip sla trace twamp connection` is active. All other releases do not require debugs to be enabled. For IOS XR, the vulnerability only affects devices with the `debug ipsla trace twamp connection` command enabled.\n*   **CVSS Score:** Base Score: 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)\n*   **Cisco Bug IDs:** CSCve33776, CSCwk80897, CSCwm63229\n*   The advisory includes instructions on how to determine if the TWAMP server is enabled and if debugs are active on affected devices.\n*   Due to the nature of the fix, Cisco is unable to develop an SMU for IOS XR and a software upgrade is required.\n*   The advisory is part of a larger bundled publication for May 2025.\n*   The advisory states that the PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.",

CWE-129 is a variant of CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), a class-level CWE. The vulnerability description specifically mentions **out-of-bounds array access**, which indicates an array index issue, making CWE-129 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1285\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe129 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe20,cwe1285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the array index (CWE-129)**, leading to an **out-of-bounds array access**. This, in turn, allows an attacker to send specially crafted TWAMP control packets, ultimately causing the affected device to reload, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (CWE-400). The root cause is clearly the lack of proper input validation on the array index.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, particularly those related to input validation and resource management. However, the presence of **out-of-bounds array access** from the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" strongly suggests that the core issue is with the validation of array indices.\nCWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) is the most specific and relevant CWE, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also considered as a secondary weakness, representing the impact of the vulnerability (DoS).\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically \"out-of-bounds array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets,\" clearly supports the selection of CWE-129. The relationship analysis further reinforces this choice, as CWE-129 is a variant of a more general input validation CWEs. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentioned CWE-20 but since we can narrow it down further, we should.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports.
