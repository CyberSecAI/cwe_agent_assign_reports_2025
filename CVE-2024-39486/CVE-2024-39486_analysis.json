This race leads to use-after-free of a struct pid. It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass through a synchronize_rcu() oper",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `drm_file_update_pid` function within the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem of the Linux kernel. This function is responsible for updating the process ID (PID) associated with a DRM file structure (`filp->pid`).\n\n**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**\n- **Race Condition:** The primary issue is that the refcount of the `struct pid` was incremented *after* the pointer was stored in `filp->pid` and after the `dev->filelist_mutex` was dropped, which enables a race condition where another process can modify `filp->pid` to point to its pid, which may be then freed causing a use-after-free.\n- **Incorrect Refcounting:** The `filp->pid` is supposed to be a refcounted pointer but was not correctly being handled.\n- **Reliance on RCU:** The race is more likely to happen with `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y` which depends on RCU to detect a quiescent state, making the race more likely.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The vulnerability leads to a use-after-free condition of a `struct pid`. This can cause the system to crash or allow for arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Concurrent Processes:** The attack requires two processes (A and B) to concurrently interact with the DRM subsystem.\n- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to trigger the race by having process A and B call `drm_file_update_pid()` at specific times, particularly when process B is between `mutex_unlock()` and `get_pid()`, while process A needs to be passing through a `synchronize_rcu()` operation\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local Access:** The attacker would require the ability to open DRM devices, which is typically a local privilege.\n- **Timing Control:** The attacker would need some ability to control the timing of when `drm_file_update_pid()` is called. It does not need precise control, but rather to increase the chance of the race condition.\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe code diffs show the fix involves taking an additional reference on the pid *before* storing the pointer to the pid in the `filp->pid`. This ensures that there will be at least one reference count of the pid if a concurrent process also updates `filp->pid`. Also, the `synchronize_rcu()` is moved outside the `if` condition.\n\n**Patch:**\nThe patch moves `get_pid(pid)` before the `mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)` which ensures that there is always an active reference when the pointer to the pid is stored in the `filp->pid`. The conditional call to `synchronize_rcu()` is also removed, simplifying the logic.\n\nThe provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description as it provides the root cause, the race condition details, the impact, the attack vectors, and the fix.",

The primary cause is a **race condition** (CWE-362) in the `drm_file_update_pid()` function. The reference material states the race condition leads to a **use-after-free** (CWE-416) of a `struct pid`. The root cause of the race condition is due to **improper update of the reference count** (CWE-911).\n\nThe evidence supporting this is:\n- \"rootcause: **race condition in drm_file_update_pid()**\"\n- \"impact: use-after-free of a struct pid\"\n- \"The primary issue is that the refcount of the `struct pid` was incremented *after* the pointer was stored in `filp->pid`\"\n\nCWE-362 is a Class, and the mapping guidance suggests there may be a more appropriate Base-level child.
