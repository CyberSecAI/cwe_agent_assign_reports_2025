The specific impact varies based on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.\\n- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, performing actions on the vulnerable plugin without their consent or knowledge.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request.
