  "description": "The MAS Static Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the static_content() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to extract potentially sensitive information from private static content pages.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The `static_content()` function in the MAS Static Content plugin did not properly check user permissions before displaying content from a static content post.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin failed to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to view a private static content post before displaying its content.\n*   **Information Exposure:** Private static content, which should only be visible to authorized users, could be accessed by users with contributor-level access or higher.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers with contributor-level access or higher could view the content of private static content pages that they should not have access to. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct Access:** By using the `mas_static_content` shortcode with the ID of a private static content post, an attacker can view its content.\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable by any authenticated user with \"contributor\" level access or higher.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.\n*   **User Role:** The attacker must have at least \"contributor\" level access or higher.\n*   **Knowledge of Static Content ID:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) the ID of the private static content post they want to access.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.9 of the plugin.\n*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin used `get_post()` to retrieve the static content post without any authorization checks on the post status.\n*   The fix adds a check using `get_post_status()` and `current_user_can('read_private_posts')` to ensure the user is authorized to read the content before displaying it.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.",

However, based on the available information, CWE-862 adequately describes the **missing authorization** check that led to the vulnerability. CWE-200 is a related weakness, representing the impact of the **missing authorization**. CWE-862 is a class level weakness and thus is at a higher level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT_OF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), which allows unauthorized access to private static content. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to attackers with contributor-level access or higher.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **missing authorization** check. The analysis of the CVE description, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" supports this conclusion. The fix implemented in version 1.0.9, which adds a check using `get_post_status()` and `current_user_can('read_private_posts')`, further reinforces the root cause as a **missing authorization** check.\n\nCWE-200 is a secondary weakness representing the impact of the primary weakness. The selection of CWE-862 is at a Class level. While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might exist, the available information does not provide sufficient detail to warrant a more specific classification. Therefore, CWE-862 is deemed the most appropriate CWE based on the current evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
