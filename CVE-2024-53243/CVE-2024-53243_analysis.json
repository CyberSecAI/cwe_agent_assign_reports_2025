Although a more specific Base-level CWE might be ideal, the available information doesn't pinpoint the exact mechanism of the incorrect authorization. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-923 (Improperly Implemented Access Control). It can also be a child of CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains).\nCWE-200 represents the impact of the authorization failure, leading to sensitive information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (identified as the root cause) due to **incorrect authorization**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors.\n- The first step is the **improper access control**.\n- The second step is **incorrect authorization**.\n- The final step is **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper access control** as the root cause, which aligns with the provided vulnerability description. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate.\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this.\nGiven the guidance provided in the prompt, **improper access control** translates to an authorization problem which is best captured by CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
