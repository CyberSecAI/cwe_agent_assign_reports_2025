  "query": "Rapid7 InsightVM Console versions below 6.6.260 suffer from a protection mechanism failure whereby an attacker with network access to the InsightVM Console can cause it to overload or crash by sending repeated invalid REST requests in a short timeframe, to the Consoles port 443 causing the console to enter an exception handling logging loop, exhausting the CPU. There is no indication that an attacker can use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue is fixed in version 6.6.261.",
