## Vulnerability Description
Weblate is a web based localization tool. Prior to version 5.11, when creating a new component from an existing component that has a source code repository URL specified in settings, this URL is included in the clients URL parameters during the creation process. If, for example, the source code repository URL contains GitHub credentials, the confidential PAT and username are shown in plaintext and get saved into browser history. Moreover, if the request URL is logged, the credentials are written to logs in plaintext. If using Weblate official Docker image, nginx logs the URL and the token in plaintext. This issue is patched in version 5.11.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **including source code repository URL in client URL parameters during component creation**
- **impact:** plaintext display of GitHub credentials
- **vector:** creation of new component from existing component
- **product:** Weblate
- **version:** prior to 5.11

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-32021 based on provided content:

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-32021 and provides more detail than the placeholder description. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from including the source code repository URL (which may contain GitHub credentials like PAT and username) in the client's URL parameters during component creation, specifically when creating a new component from an existing one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-598:** Exposure of sensitive information in logging and browser history.
*   Insecure handling of sensitive data (GitHub PAT and username) in URL parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Compromised server logs:** If server logs are accessed by an attacker, they could gain access to private repositories.
*   **Browser history exposure:**  The credentials are saved in browser history, making them accessible to malicious browser extensions or other actors with access to the browser profile.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploitation occurs during the component creation process in Weblate.
*   Access to server logs.
*   Access to the victim's browser history.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to observe the URL parameters during the component creation process.
*   Access to server logs or the victim's browser history.
*   No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, but access to logs or browser history is needed for exploitation.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in Weblate version 5.11.  Updating to this version resolves the issue.
*   The fix involves preventing the inclusion of sensitive credentials in URL parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Weblate (pip package) versions less than 5.11.
*   **CVSS Score:** 2.2 / 10 (Low severity)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
*   **EPSS Score:** 0.067% (21st percentile)
*   The content includes examples of the vulnerable URL and nginx log entries demonstrating the exposure of credentials.
*   The vulnerability was reported by joonashak and remediated by nijel, with review by gersona.
