While the description indicates **Improper Access Control**, the specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed enough to definitively choose between missing or incorrect authorization. Therefore, the more general CWE-284 was initially selected. The Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance suggests using CWE-284 when the root cause is unclear. If more details were provided to suggest authorization was missing then it would make sense to choose CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control**, leading to the impact of physical attackers being able to access video files of other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **Improper Access Control** (**rootcause**) as highlighted in the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The primary choice, CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), is supported by the fact that a more specific cause, like **missing authorization** or **incorrect authorization**, isn't explicitly stated. The guidance notes that \"If the access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, but it's not due to missing checks, consider CWE-284.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at a higher level of abstraction (Pillar) since the available evidence doesn't allow for a more specific classification. The evidence provided is sufficient to justify the selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
