A security vulnerability was discovered in the `gardenlet` component of Gardener prior to versions 1.116.4, 1.117.5, 1.118.2, and 1.119.0. It could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project to obtain control over the seed cluster(s) where their shoot clusters are managed. This CVE affects all Gardener installations where gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp is in use. Versions 1.116.4, 1.117.5, 1.118.2, and 1.119.0 fix the issue.",
