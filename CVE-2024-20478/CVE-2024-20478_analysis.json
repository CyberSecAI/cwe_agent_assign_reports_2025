  "description": "A vulnerability in the software upgrade component of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco&nbspCloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to install a modified software image, leading to arbitrary code injection on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient signature validation** of software images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to root. Note Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller.",

CWE-94 (Code Injection) is considered as a potential consequence, connected through a CANPRECEDE relationship if the injected code is executed. The relationship analysis focuses on identifying the root cause (signature validation failure) and potential impacts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe347\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient signature validation** (CWE-347). This leads to the acceptance of a modified software image. The modified image can then allow for arbitrary code injection (CWE-94), culminating in privilege escalation to root.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-347 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's explicit mention of **\"insufficient signature validation\"** and the CVE reference summary confirming this as the root cause. The successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation, suggesting CWE-94 as a secondary, potential impact. The selection is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and confirmed by the Retriever results. The provided relationship graph highlights the connection between the **root cause** and the possible exploitation path.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
