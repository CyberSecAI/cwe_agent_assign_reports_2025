# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-9417
## Query
The Hash Form - Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited file uploads due to a misconfigured file type validation in the handleUpload function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload files that are excluded from both the allowedExtensions and unallowed_extensions arrays on the affected sites server, including files that may contain cross-site scripting.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'misconfigured file type validation'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting'
