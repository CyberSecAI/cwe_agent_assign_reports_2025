# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9767

## Description

IrfanView SID File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SID files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-23277.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** Out-Of-Bounds Read
- **Impact:** ['Remote Code Execution', 'execute arbitrary code', 'execute code in the context of the current process']
- **Attacker:** remote attackers

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base |  Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is an Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125) caused by a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. CWE-125 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-20 is a Class level CWE. CWE-20 is a more general case of **improper input validation**, but the description specifies an **out-of-bounds read**, indicating CWE-125 is the more specific and appropriate choice for the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** which leads to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** vulnerability. This then allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated key phrases, which explicitly state a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leading to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause is a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and the weakness is an **out-of-bounds read vulnerability**.

The retriever results also list CWE-125 with high similarity scores. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is listed as the Primary CWE Match and has the highest retriever score, the vulnerability description specifically mentions an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**. Therefore, CWE-125 is selected as the primary CWE because it is the most accurate representation of the weakness described in the vulnerability. CWE-20 is considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause of the vulnerability. However, CWE-125 is preferred because it is a more specific description of the vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 being a Base level CWE and directly reflecting the described vulnerability.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
