## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView SID File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SID files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-23277.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SID files within IrfanView. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data when parsing SID files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious SID file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SID file to the victim, either through a malicious website or a file that the user opens. User interaction is required, meaning the victim has to open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.
