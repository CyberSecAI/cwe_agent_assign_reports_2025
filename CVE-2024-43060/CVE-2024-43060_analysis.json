This is a child of the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). There are no explicit chain relationships mentioned in the description but typically CWE-787 can be preceded by integer overflows (CWE-190) or incorrect buffer size calculations (CWE-131) although there is no mention of this in the description.. The base level of CWE-787 is the most appropriate level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple. The root cause is a **memory corruption**, which leads to an out-of-bounds write when sound model parameters are loaded.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **memory corruption** issue leading to an out-of-bounds write when loading sound model parameters. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary candidate. Given that the description explicitly mentions \"memory corruption,\" and the operation involves loading sound model parameters (suggesting a write operation), CWE-787 is the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), CWE-415 (Double Free), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-134 (Use of Externally-Controlled Format String), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) were considered but not selected. None of these adequately capture the specific **memory corruption** during a write operation described in the vulnerability.\nThe evidence for selecting CWE-787 is based on the **memory corruption** during a write operation as described in the \"Vulnerability Description\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write",
