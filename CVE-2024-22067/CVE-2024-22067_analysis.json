An authenticated attacker leverages this weakness in the Web module interface to **execute arbitrary commands** (CWE-78).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which points to an **improper permission control** vulnerability in the ZTE NH8091 product's Web module interface. The root cause is the **improper authorization** (CWE-285), which enables an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands (CWE-78).\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-285 because the **improper authorization** is the root cause that allows the attacker to execute commands. CWE-78 is secondary, representing the impact of the **improper authorization**. While CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE and normally discouraged, there is not enough evidence to assign a more granular CWE, so it is the most appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2175.33\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
