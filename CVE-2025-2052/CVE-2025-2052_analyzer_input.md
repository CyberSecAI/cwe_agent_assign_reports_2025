## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
* Root cause of vulnerability: A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/forgot-password.php' Apartment Visitors Management System ' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'contactno' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.
* Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection
* Impact of exploitation: Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.
* Attack vectors: The 'contactno' parameter in the '/forgot-password.php' file.
* Required attacker capabilities/position: The ability to send a POST request to the '/forgot-password.php' endpoint with a malicious payload in the 'contactno' parameter.
* Mitigation or fix:
    *   Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries).
    *   Sanitize User Inputs: Validate and filter all incoming data.
    *   Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    *   Use the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for database users.
    *   Regularly Update and Patch the Application.
