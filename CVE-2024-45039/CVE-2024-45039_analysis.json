  "description": "gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of **multiple commitments** used inside the circuit the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for optimized non-native multiplication, lookup checks etc. as random challenges, then it could impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However, using **multiple commitments** has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnarks maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with **multiple commitments**. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users should follow gnark maintainers recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed using the `std/multicommit` package.",

This allows a malicious prover to mix basis elements between commitments.\",\n  \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"The vulnerability allows a malicious prover to manipulate commitments by choosing all but one commitment arbitrarily and then calculating the remaining one to satisfy the sum, leading to an unsound proof.\",\n  \"Impact of exploitation\": \"A malicious prover can construct a proof that will be accepted by the verifier despite manipulating the committed values, breaking the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system. This allows the prover to potentially influence in-circuit challenges before knowing the witness assignments, which can be critical for Fiat-Shamir transforms and random linear combinations.\",\n  \"Attack vectors\": \"The attack can be performed by a malicious prover generating the Groth16 proof. The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs access to the system where the proof is being generated. The attack complexity is low, requiring no user interaction or special privileges.\",\n  \"Required attacker capabilities/position\": \"The attacker needs to be in the position of the prover in the Groth16 proof system and able to modify the proof generation process, specifically the commitment values and their proofs of knowledge. They also need to understand the underlying math and exploit the lack of separate \u03c3 values for each commitment.\"\n}\n```",

However, the description focuses more on the misuse of commitments leading to manipulation of challenges, linking it closer to PRNG issues rather than just general randomness. The final selection favored the specific details related to random number generation processes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe335[\"CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    \n    cwe335 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe335 primary\n    class cwe330 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **incorrect usage of multiple commitments** in the Groth16 proving system, which leads to the use of the same sigma value for all proofs of knowledge. This **weakness** allows a malicious prover to manipulate commitments and influence in-circuit challenges due to the misuse of randomness. The final impact is breaking the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).\n  - Impact: Malicious prover can construct a proof accepted by the verifier, manipulating committed values.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** related to **multiple commitments** and their impact on the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases pointed to issues related to randomness. The final decision was to assign CWE-335 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems from using the same sigma value, which is akin to misusing a seed in a PRNG, enabling the manipulation of challenges. The evidence supporting this is the description stating that the commitments are used \"as random challenges\" and the root cause explanation that \"the same \u03c3 (sigma) value is used for all proofs of knowledge.\" This indicates a flaw in how randomness is handled.
