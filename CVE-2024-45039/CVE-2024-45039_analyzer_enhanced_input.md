## Vulnerability Description
gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of **multiple commitments** used inside the circuit the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for optimized non-native multiplication, lookup checks etc. as random challenges, then it could impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However, using **multiple commitments** has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnarks maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with **multiple commitments**. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users should follow gnark maintainers recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed using the `std/multicommit` package.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **multiple commitments**
- **impact:** choose all but last commitment
- **product:** gnark
- **version:** prior to 0.11.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the same σ (sigma) value is used for all proofs of knowledge associated with multiple commitments in the Groth16 proving system. This allows a malicious prover to mix basis elements between commitments.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a malicious prover to manipulate commitments by choosing all but one commitment arbitrarily and then calculating the remaining one to satisfy the sum, leading to an unsound proof.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious prover can construct a proof that will be accepted by the verifier despite manipulating the committed values, breaking the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system. This allows the prover to potentially influence in-circuit challenges before knowing the witness assignments, which can be critical for Fiat-Shamir transforms and random linear combinations.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be performed by a malicious prover generating the Groth16 proof. The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs access to the system where the proof is being generated. The attack complexity is low, requiring no user interaction or special privileges.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in the position of the prover in the Groth16 proof system and able to modify the proof generation process, specifically the commitment values and their proofs of knowledge. They also need to understand the underlying math and exploit the lack of separate σ values for each commitment."
