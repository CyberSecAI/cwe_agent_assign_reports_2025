# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1734

## Vulnerability Description
In PHP from 8.1.* before 8.1.32, from 8.2.* before 8.2.28, from 8.3.* before 8.3.19, from 8.4.* before 8.4.5, when receiving headers from HTTP server, the **headers missing a colon () are treated as valid headers** even though they are not. This may confuse applications into accepting invalid headers.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **headers missing a colon () are treated as valid headers**
- **vector:** receiving headers from HTTP server
- **product:** PHP
- **impact:** ['accept invalid headers', 'confuse applications into accepting invalid headers']
- **version:** ['from 8.1.* before 8.1.32', 'from 8.2.* before 8.2.28', 'from 8.3.* before 8.3.19', 'from 8.4.* before 8.4.5']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1734 based on provided content:

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2025-1734. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the GitHub security advisory (github.com_bc045665):

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Streams HTTP wrapper in PHP does not properly handle HTTP headers with invalid names (missing a colon) or spaces in the header name before the colon, violating RFC standards.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper input validation of HTTP headers.
*   Failure to adhere to RFC standards for HTTP header formatting.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Potential for request smuggling due to incorrect header parsing.
*   Application logic errors when parsing the `$http_response_header` array, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   Misinterpretation of invalid headers as valid or as continuations of previous headers.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending crafted HTTP responses with invalid header names to a PHP application using the Streams HTTP wrapper.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the HTTP response received by the PHP application. This could be through a man-in-the-middle position or by controlling a server that the PHP application interacts with.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to PHP version 8.1.32 or later, 8.2.28 or later, 8.3.19 or later, or 8.4.5 or later.
*   As a workaround, applications can implement custom handling of the `$http_response_header` array to filter out invalid headers.

**Additional details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The advisory provides a code example demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   It clarifies that the vulnerability does *not* trigger notifications, so no extra handling is needed for that aspect.
*   It specifies the affected PHP versions and the patched versions.
*   It assigns a severity of "Moderate".
*   It notes that no CWEs are currently associated with this vulnerability.
