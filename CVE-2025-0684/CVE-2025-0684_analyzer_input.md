# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0684

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem, grubs reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it **improperly checks for integer overflows**. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter, leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** reiserfs fs module
- **rootcause:** **improperly checks for integer overflows**
- **vector:** maliciously crafted filesystem
- **weakness:** **heap based out-of-bounds write, buffer size calculations overflow**
- **product:** grub2
- **impact:** ['arbitrary code execution', 'bypass secure boot protections', 'corrupt grubs internal critical data']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0684 Content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-0684, as described in the bug report:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references "CVE-2025-0684" and provides a description aligning with a vulnerability in `grub2` related to `reiserfs`. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when handling symlinks in the `reiserfs` filesystem module within `grub2`. The vulnerability stems from improper checks for integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes using user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Integer overflow
    *   Heap-based out-of-bounds write
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Corruption of `grub`'s internal critical data.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution, bypassing secure boot protections.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Maliciously crafted `reiserfs` filesystem.
    *   Exploitation occurs during symlink lookup.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to create or modify a `reiserfs` filesystem.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in this content.

**3. Details beyond official CVE description:**

The bug report provides a more detailed explanation of *how* the integer overflow leads to the out-of-bounds write, specifically mentioning the `grub_reiserfs_read_symlink()` and `grub_reiserfs_read_real()` functions and the overflowed length parameter. It also explicitly states the potential to bypass secure boot protections.
