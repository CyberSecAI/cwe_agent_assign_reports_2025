  "query": "A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem, grubs reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter, leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.",
