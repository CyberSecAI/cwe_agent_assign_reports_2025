# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48789

## Vulnerability Description
An issue in INATRONIC com.inatronic.drivedeck.home 2.6.23 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitve information via the firmware update process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain sensitve information
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** INATRONIC com.inatronic.drivedeck.home
- **version:** 2.6.23
- **component:** firmware update process

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48789.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of access control on the vendor's firmware server. The server directly provides firmware files in response to a GET request without any authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The firmware server does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict who can download the firmware files.
- **Firmware Leakage:** The lack of access control leads to the exposure of the firmware files to anyone who knows the download URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Firmware Access:** An attacker can download the latest firmware before its official release.
- **Firmware Analysis:** Downloaded firmware can be analyzed for vulnerabilities and proprietary information.
- **Malicious Firmware Creation:** Attackers can create modified firmware images containing malicious code.
- **Compromised Firmware Distribution:** Malicious firmware can be distributed to unsuspecting users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Requests:** The attacker uses HTTP GET requests to the firmware server using the URL obtained through reverse engineering of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Reverse Engineering Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to reverse engineer the application to identify the firmware download mechanism and URLs.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the firmware server to send the HTTP requests.
