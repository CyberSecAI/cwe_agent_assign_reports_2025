CWE-284 is a parent (Pillar) CWE, and many more specific CWEs fall under it. The vulnerability description indicates a general **improper access control** issue, but lacks specific details to pinpoint a more precise CWE. CWE-200 is related to sensitive information exposure, which is the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284), which leads to local attackers being able to access sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states \"**Improper access control**\", which directly points to CWE-284. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with \"root_cause: Improper access control\" and \"weaknesses: Improper access control\".\n\nCWE-284 is chosen as the primary CWE because it reflects the stated root cause. CWE-200 is included as a secondary candidate because it describes the impact of the **improper access control**, which is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results suggest other potential CWEs, such as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). However, the provided information doesn't specify whether the issue is related to missing authentication, missing authorization, or incorrect authorization. Given the lack of specificity, CWE-284 remains the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe CWE guidance suggests avoiding CWE-284 if a more specific child CWE is applicable, but in this case, the evidence is insufficient to determine a more specific root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1245.54\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
