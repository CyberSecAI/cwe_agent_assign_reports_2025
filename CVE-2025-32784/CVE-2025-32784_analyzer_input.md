# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-32784

# Vulnerability Description

    conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a **race condition** vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue**, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 1081.32)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 935.47)
