  "query": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Application Object Library product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Core). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Object Library. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Application Object Library, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRN/UIR/SC/CL/IL/AN).",
