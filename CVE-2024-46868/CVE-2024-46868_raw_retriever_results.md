## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware qcom uefisecapp Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire() If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in the original code, we would hold onto the lock. That means that if we tried to set it later, then it would cause a deadlock. Drop the lock on the error path. Thats what all the callers are expecting.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'If the __qcuefi pointer is not set', 'then in the original code', 'we would hold onto the lock'
- **weakness**: 'deadlock'
