# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37893

## Vulnerability Description
Firefly III is a free and open source personal finance manager. In affected versions an **MFA bypass** in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users to bypass the MFA-check. This allows malicious users to use password spraying to gain access to Firefly III data using passwords stolen from other sources. As OAuth applications are easily enumerable using an incrementing id, an attacker could try sign an OAuth application up to a users profile quite easily if they have created one. The attacker would also need to know the victims username and password. This problem has been patched in Firefly III v6.1.17 and up. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should Use a unique password for their Firefly III instance and store their password securely, i.e. in a password manager.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **MFA bypass**
- **impact:** bypass the MFA-check
- **vector:** password spraying
- **attacker:** malicious users
- **product:** Firefly III
- **version:** before v6.1.17
- **component:** OAuth flow

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Firefly III OAuth flow that allows multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be bypassed. Specifically, the OAuth application enumeration combined with knowledge of the victim's credentials allowed an attacker to add their application to the victim's profile and then gain access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **MFA Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to circumvent the MFA check during the OAuth authentication process.
- **OAuth Application Enumeration:** The vulnerability is facilitated by the ability to easily enumerate OAuth applications using incrementing IDs. This allows attackers to potentially discover and target valid OAuth applications.
- **Password Spraying:** The MFA bypass enables attackers to leverage password spraying techniques, using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass MFA and gain unauthorized access to a user's Firefly III account.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored within the compromised Firefly III instance.
- **Account Takeover:** Malicious users can potentially fully take over a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OAuth Flow Exploitation:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the OAuth flow to bypass MFA.
- **Password Spraying:** Attackers use stolen or common passwords across multiple accounts to gain access.
- **OAuth Application Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate OAuth applications to identify valid targets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Victim's Credentials:** The attacker must know the victim's username and password to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Enumerate OAuth Applications:** The attacker needs the ability to enumerate OAuth applications using incremental IDs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content references password spraying and MFA bypass attacks, which are relevant to understanding the vulnerability.
- Mitigation strategies include using unique passwords, storing passwords securely, and implementing account lockout policies, which are generally good security practices.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefly III version 6.1.17 and later.
