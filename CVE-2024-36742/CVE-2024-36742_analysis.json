The vulnerability description indicates that the **index parameter exceeds the range of shape**, which suggests a problem with input validation. If the index parameter is not properly validated (CWE-1284), it can lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which can then result in a denial-of-service (CWE-400) condition due to resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of the index parameter**, leading to an out-of-bounds write, and ultimately resulting in a denial of service.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)\n  - **Impact:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the root cause. The vulnerability description indicates the **index parameter exceeds the range of shape**, meaning the input (index parameter) is not validated against the expected range (shape).\n\nThe selection of CWE-1284 is based on the fact that the input parameter `index` is not properly validated against the `shape` leading to an out-of-bounds write. This is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered a secondary candidate as the exceeding of shape range leads to this condition.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also considered as the final impact, as the out-of-bounds write can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): These are specific types of buffer overflows. While an out-of-bounds write *could* lead to a buffer overflow, the description doesn't explicitly mention it.\n*   CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion): No assertion is mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): The description does not mention resource allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
