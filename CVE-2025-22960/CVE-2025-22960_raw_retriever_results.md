# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-22960
## Query
A session hijacking vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface of GatesAir Maxiva UAXT, VAXT transmitters. Unauthenticated attackers can access exposed log files (/logs/debug/xteLog*), potentially revealing sensitive session-related information such as session IDs (sess_id) and authentication success tokens (user_check_password OK). Exploiting this flaw could allow attackers to hijack active sessions, gain unauthorized access, and escalate privileges on affected devices.
