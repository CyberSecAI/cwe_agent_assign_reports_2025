  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Consumer Comanda Mobile up to 14.9.3.2/15.0.0.8. This affects an unknown part of the component Restaurant Order Handler. The manipulation of the argument Login/Password leads to **cleartext transmission** of sensitive information. The attack can only be initiated within the local network. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3329 based on provided content\n\nThis content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-3329 and provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe restaurant ordering system uses HTTP for communication, lacks encryption (connection is \"N\u00e3o Seguro\" - Not Secure), and relies on cookies for authentication. This allows an attacker to intercept network traffic and steal cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Lack of Encryption:** Communication between the waiter's devices and the order management panel is unencrypted (HTTP).\n*   **Cookie-Based Authentication:** The system relies on cookies for authentication, making them a valuable target for attackers.\n*   **Wi-Fi Security:** The system operates on a Wi-Fi network, which can be compromised through various attacks.\n*   **ARP Spoofing Vulnerability:** The system is susceptible to ARP spoofing attacks, allowing an attacker to intercept traffic.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the order management panel without valid credentials.\n*   **Order Manipulation:** Attackers can edit orders, potentially resulting in free meals or bypassed charges.\n*   **Data Theft:** Interception of network traffic can expose sensitive data like passwords and form data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Wi-Fi Pineapple/Evil Twin Attack:** Creating a fake Wi-Fi network to intercept traffic.\n*   **ARP Spoofing:** Redirecting traffic through the attacker's machine using a Python exploit (PacketPlatter).\n*   **Packet Capture (TCPDump/Wireshark):** Capturing network traffic to extract cookies and other sensitive information.\n*   **Social Engineering:** Obtaining the Wi-Fi password from restaurant employees.\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting and manipulating communication between the waiter's device and the order management panel.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the restaurant's Wi-Fi network (physical proximity or social engineering).\n*   **Technical Skills:** Knowledge of networking, Wi-Fi security, packet capture tools (Wireshark, TCPDump), and potentially Python scripting (for ARP spoofing).\n*   **Tools:** WiFi Pineapple, Scapy (for PacketPlatter), Wireshark, Cookie Quick Manager (Firefox extension).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Implement HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the waiter's devices and the order management panel.\n*   **ARP Spoofing Detection:** Implement tools to detect and prevent ARP spoofing attacks.\n*   **Static ARP Entries:** Configure static ARP entries to prevent ARP table manipulation.\n*   **Network Segmentation:** Create a dedicated Wi-Fi network for the ordering system, separate from the public network.\n*   **Strong Wi-Fi Encryption:** Use WPA3 for stronger Wi-Fi encryption.\n*   **Staff Training:** Educate restaurant staff about security best practices.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.",

The description focuses on the **lack of encryption** in the transmission of sensitive information, not on input validation or intent handling.\n\n**CWE-319**: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **cleartext transmission** of sensitive information. The CVE Reference Links content summary confirms this weakness by highlighting the **lack of encryption**. This allows unauthorized actors to sniff the communication channel and intercept sensitive data.\n**CWE-522**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials is a secondary CWE because the CVE Reference Links content summary indicates the system relies on cookies for authentication but lacks encryption. This makes the credentials susceptible to interception and unauthorized retrieval.\n**CWE-306**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function is a secondary CWE because the CVE Reference Links content summary points out the **lack of encryption** that can lead to unauthorized access of the system without credentials.",
