The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have that information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862, which is a class-level CWE. While it would be ideal to find a more specific base or variant CWE, the provided information does not give enough information to descend to a more detailed level. CWE-862 is related to other authorization-related CWEs like CWE-285 and CWE-863, but those are not appropriate because they describe *incorrect* authorization, not **missing** authorization. CWE-862 can lead to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information), as the **missing authorization** allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862). This **missing authorization** allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-862 Missing Authorization.\n  - **Impact:** CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **missing capability check** on the `ajax()` function, which directly maps to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The impact of this **missing authorization** is that unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files, leading to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate. CWE-200 is included as it is the result of the **missing authorization** and the sensitive information can be read.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, leveraging the use of a reversible weak algorithm, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\"\n\nCWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639 were considered but not used. These involve *incorrect* or *bypassed* authorization, not a **missing** authorization check.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but not used because the issue is specifically a **missing authorization** check, not a **missing authentication** check. The function is likely already authenticated, but there is no further check to see if the authenticated user is authorized to access the specific file.\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) was considered, but it's not the primary issue. CSRF is about tricking a user into performing actions they didn't intend, whereas this vulnerability is about directly accessing files without proper authorization.\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was also considered, but it is about uploading dangerous files, which is not the case here.",
