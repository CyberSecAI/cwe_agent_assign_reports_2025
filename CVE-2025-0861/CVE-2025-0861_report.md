# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0861

## Description

The VR-Frases (collect & share quotes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via several parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** ['extract sensitive information from the database', 'append additional SQL queries']
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** VR-Frases plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 3.0.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE. There are child CWEs of CWE-89 like CWE-564 (SQL Injection: Hibernate), which is a Variant. However, the description doesn't specify that Hibernate is involved, so using CWE-89 is more appropriate. CWE-89 is also a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic), which is a Class. CWE-943 is too general given the specific nature of SQL injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **SQL injection**, which can be used to extract sensitive information from the database and append additional SQL queries.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the VR-Frases plugin is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-89. The description also mentions the impact of the vulnerability, which is to extract sensitive information from the database and append additional SQL queries. This is a direct consequence of SQL injection.

The evidence for this assessment is derived directly from the vulnerability description: "The VR-Frases (collect & share quotes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via several parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**."

CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is related to Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While encoding/escaping is related to SQL injection, the description specifically mentions **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes CWE-89 a more direct and accurate fit.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Deserialization is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not directly related to SQL injection.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Authorization issues are not the primary concern.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Cross-site scripting (XSS) is not mentioned.

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* CRLF injection is not mentioned.

## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Eval injection is not mentioned.

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected:* This CWE matches the **root cause** and the weakness indicated in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information
