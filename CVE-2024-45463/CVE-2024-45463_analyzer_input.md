## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45463:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure when parsing specially crafted WRL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data beyond the boundaries of the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can cause the application to crash

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious WRL File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious WRL file using the affected applications.
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs user interaction to open the malicious WRL file.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to place the malicious file on the local system and get a user to open it.

**Affected Products:**
*   Teamcenter Visualization V14.2 (All versions < V14.2.0.14)
*   Teamcenter Visualization V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.12)
*   Teamcenter Visualization V2312 (All versions < V2312.0008)
*   Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 (All versions < V2302.0016)
*   Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0005)
