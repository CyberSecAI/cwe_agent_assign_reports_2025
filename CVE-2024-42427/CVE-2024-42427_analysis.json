This leads to **command injection**, which an unauthenticated attacker can exploit to achieve **elevation of privileges**.\n\nImproper Neutralization -> Command Injection -> Elevation of Privileges\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command**\" and indicates a **command injection** vulnerability. This aligns with the characteristics of CWE-78, which focuses on the **improper neutralization** of special elements within OS commands. The impact is elevation of privileges.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: **Improper neutralization** of special elements used in a command, leading to a **command injection** vulnerability.\"\n\nCWE-77 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more general class, while CWE-78 is a more specific base that accurately reflects the vulnerability's details.\n\nCWE-250 was considered because the impact is elevation of privileges, but the root cause is the command injection. So, CWE-250 is not the primary issue.\n\nThe confidence in the selection of CWE-78 is high (0.9) due to the direct evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
