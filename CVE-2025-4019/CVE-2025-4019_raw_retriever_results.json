Affected is the function genCode of the file novel-admin/src/main/java/com/java2nb/common/controller/GeneratorController.java. The manipulation leads to missing authentication. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
