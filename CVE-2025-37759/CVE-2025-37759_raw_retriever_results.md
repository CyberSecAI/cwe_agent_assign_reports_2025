In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ublk fix handling recovery & reissue in ublk_abort_queue() Commit 8284066946e6 (ublk grab request reference when the request is handled by userspace) doesnt grab request reference in case of recovery reissue. Then the request can be requeued & re-dispatch & failed when canceling uring command. If it is one zc request, the request can be freed before io_uring returns the zc buffer back, then cause kernel panic [ 126.773061]
