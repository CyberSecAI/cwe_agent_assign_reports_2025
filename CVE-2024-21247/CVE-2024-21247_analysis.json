CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is a potential secondary weakness representing the impact of the missing authentication. The relationship is that the missing authentication can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -- IMPACT --> cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (**CWE-306**), which allows an attacker with high privileges and network access to perform unauthorized actions. This leads to unauthorized update, insert, or delete access, as well as unauthorized read access to data (**CWE-200**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase indicating the root cause is the potential for **unauthorized** update, insert or delete access and **unauthorized** read access which points to an authentication or authorization issue.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** as a potential candidate, which aligns with the lack of authentication controls. Although CWE-306 is listed with a lower score, the detailed description of the vulnerability supports the selection of this CWE as the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is considered a secondary weakness, representing the impact of the missing authentication. This is a class-level CWE, and while discouraged for primary mapping, it is acceptable as a secondary CWE to represent the impact.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (**CWE-306**) and the resulting impact (**CWE-200**).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
