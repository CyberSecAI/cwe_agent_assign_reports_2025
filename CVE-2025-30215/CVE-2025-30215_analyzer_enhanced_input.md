## Vulnerability Description
NATS-Server is a High-Performance server for NATS.io, the cloud and edge native messaging system. In versions starting from 2.2.0 but prior to 2.10.27 and 2.11.1, the management of JetStream assets happens with messages in the $JS. subject namespace in the system account this is partially exposed into regular accounts to allow account holders to manage their assets. Some of the JS API requests were **missing access controls**, allowing any user with JS management permissions in any account to perform certain administrative actions on any JS asset in any other account. At least one of the unprotected APIs allows for data destruction. None of the affected APIs allow disclosing stream contents. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.11.1 or v2.10.27.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing access controls**
- **product:** NATS-Server
- **impact:** data destruction, disclosing stream contents
- **attacker:** any user with JS management permissions in any account
- **version:** 2.2.0 to 2.10.27 and 2.11.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-30215 Content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on details related to CVE-2025-30215, following the given guidelines:

**1. Verification:**

The content consistently references CVE-2025-30215 and its aliases (GHSA-fhg8-qxh5-7q3w, GO-2025-3600), confirming its relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Missing access controls for JetStream (JS) API requests. Specifically, JS API requests were not properly restricted, allowing users with JS management permissions in *any* account to perform administrative actions on JS assets in *other* accounts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Lack of proper authorization checks on certain JetStream admin APIs.
*   Insufficient access control mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data destruction:** At least one unprotected API allows for the destruction of data.
*   **Loss of data redundancy/service quality:** Removal of servers from JetStream clusters is possible.
*   **Loss of control of data provenance:** Streams can be moved between servers.
*   **Account Isolation Violation:**  Actions can be performed across account boundaries.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploitation occurs through the use of unprotected JS APIs.
*   An attacker needs to be a user with JS management permissions in *any* account.
*   The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker must be an authenticated user with JS management permissions.
*   The attacker does not need system-level privileges.
*   The attacker only needs permission to publish on `$JS.>`.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade NATS server to version 2.11.1 or 2.10.27.
*   Ensure users do not have unnecessary permissions for `$JS.>` or `$JS.API.ACCOUNT.>` or `$JS.API.SERVER.>`

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Specific APIs affected:**
    *   `ACCOUNT.PURGE.*` (highest severity - data destruction)
    *   `SERVER.REMOVE` (loss of redundancy)
    *   `ACCOUNT.STREAM.MOVE.*.*` and `CANCEL_MOVE` (data provenance, service quality)
*   **PoC (Proof of Concept):** The GitHub content provides a detailed PoC demonstrating how an attacker can purge an account they do not own.
*   **CVSS Score:** Critical - 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H)
*   **Reporter:** Thomas Morgan reported the issue on 2025-03-05.
*   **Timeline Note:** The GHSA advisory was in draft status as of 2025-04-08.
*   **Workarounds:** None are available.
*   **Affected Versions:** NATS Server version 2 from v2.2.0 onwards, prior to v2.11.1 or v2.10.27.

**3. Content Source Assessment:**

*   **advisories.nats.io:** Provides the initial advisory information, background, problem description, affected versions, and solution.
*   **github.com:** Offers a more detailed report, including a PoC, CVSS score, and a breakdown of the affected APIs.
*   **openwall.com:** Contains the original security announcement and links to related resources.

**4. Response Type:**

RELEVANT - The content is directly related to CVE-2025-30215 and provides valuable information about the vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
