The specific impact will vary depending on the functionality of the plugin and the actions available to users.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious web page or email containing a CSRF exploit.\\n*   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit the malicious page or click on a link in the email.\\n*  If the user visits the malicious page or clicks the malicious link, the forged request will be sent to the vulnerable site, executing the attacker's desired action on behalf of the logged-in user.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, privileged user into interacting with the malicious content/link.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1 which is considered high, but patchstack assigns it a low priority due to the unlikelihood of exploitation.\\n* The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control\\n*  No official fix is currently available.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Syed Umair Hussain Shah World Prayer Time', 'keyphrase': 'Syed Umair Hussain Shah World Prayer Time', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(270.8156474806302)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(203.3871075164775)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
