## Vulnerability Description
The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a querys height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** operation limits plugin
- **rootcause:** **unintended integer overflow**
- **product:** Apollo Router Core
- **impact:** bypass configured thresholds, bypass query limits
- **version:** prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, 1.61.2 and 2.1.1

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs CPU computations using
         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the
         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be
         optimized further.

### Extended Description


This issue can make the product perform more slowly, possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users. If an attacker can influence the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-405

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-37734:** Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough (CWE-696), allowing excessive CPU consumption (CWE-1176)




## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
PeerOf -> CWE-190

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.






## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704
ChildOf -> CWE-704
CanPrecede -> CWE-682

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2639:** Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
