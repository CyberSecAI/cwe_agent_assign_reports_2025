  "description": "Wyze Cam v3 Cloud Infrastructure Improper Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the run_action_batch endpoint of the cloud infrastructure. The issue results from the use of the devices MAC address as a sole credential for authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22393.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6248\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the Wyze Cam v3 cloud infrastructure's use of the device's MAC address as the sole credential for authentication. This weak authentication allows attackers to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the device.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the inadequate authentication mechanism, which relies solely on the device's MAC address. MAC addresses are easily discoverable and spoofable, making them unsuitable for secure authentication.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication entirely.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected Wyze Cam v3 devices. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.\n- **Root access:** The vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, allows for code execution in the context of root, granting extensive control to the attacker.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-Adjacent Attacks:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable Wyze Cam v3 device.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be located on the same network segment as the targeted Wyze Cam v3 device.\n- **Knowledge of MAC Address:** The attacker needs to know the MAC address of the target Wyze Cam v3.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The vulnerability exists in the `run_action_batch` endpoint of the cloud infrastructure.\n- The vulnerability was reported to Wyze on 2023-11-15, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2024-06-21.\n- Wyze has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.",

CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), making it a more specific choice when authentication is completely missing. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) represents a related, but distinct, scenario where authentication exists but can be bypassed. CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) while present in the retriever results, represents another improper authentication scenario.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe288,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for a critical function (`run_action_batch` endpoint). This leads to the ability to bypass security measures (CWE-288). Ultimately, this allows for remote code execution, which can be leveraged for root access, if combined with other vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly based on the explicit statement that \"Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability\" and \"The issue results from the use of the devices MAC address as a sole credential for authentication.\" This clearly indicates a **missing authentication** issue (CWE-306). The evidence suggests that the MAC address is being used *instead* of proper authentication, thus allowing for a bypass (CWE-288).\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results helped to consider alternative classifications, but the core issue is the complete absence of a proper authentication mechanism for a critical function. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause (CWE-306) and the direct consequence (CWE-288).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
