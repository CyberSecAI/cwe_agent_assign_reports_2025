  "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to read or write files on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because of **missing authorization controls** on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files. Note This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.",

CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285, indicating a more specific type of authorization issue where authorization is entirely missing. This hierarchical relationship guides the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE because it more precisely describes the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization controls** on REST API endpoints (CWE-862). This **missing authorization** allows an authenticated, low-privileged attacker to send crafted API requests, leading to the ability to read and write files on the affected device. The root cause is the **missing authorization**, and the impact is unauthorized file access and modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **missing authorization controls** as the key weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the REST API endpoints lack authorization checks, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-862 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong because the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights \"**missing authorization controls**\" as the **rootcause**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also reinforces this by stating, \"Missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints in Cisco NDFC.\" This provides direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-862.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-862 is a more specific child of CWE-285, making it the preferred choice for this vulnerability. The provided guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control further supports this decision, as the issue lies in the absence of authorization checks rather than a general access control problem.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-862 is the optimal choice for representing this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
