  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in code-projects Chat System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /admin/deleteroom.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of the `id` parameter in the `/admin/deleteroom.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into the database query.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where untrusted user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries. Specifically a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection is possible.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `id` parameter received through the `$_POST` array.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database (as the provided code already does).\n- **Information Disclosure:** Using time-based SQL injection, an attacker can infer information from the database by causing delays in the response. This can be used to extract sensitive information.\n- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection may serve as a stepping stone for more severe attacks, such as privilege escalation or complete system compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/admin/deleteroom.php`, with a maliciously crafted `id` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/deleteroom.php` and that the `id` parameter is vulnerable.\n- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable code is within `/admin/deleteroom.php`:\n```php\n<?php\n\tinclude('../conn.php');\n\n\tif (isset($_POST['del'])){\n\t\t$id=$_POST['id'];\n\n\t\tmysqli_query($conn,\"delete from `chatroom` where chatroomid='$id'\");\n\t\tmysqli_query($conn,\"delete from `chat` where chatroomid='$id'\");\n\t\tmysqli_query($conn,\"delete from `chat_member` where chatroomid='$id'\");\n\t}\n?>\n```\n- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using `sleep(5)`:\n```\nPOST /admin/deleteroom.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: 127.0.0.1:7777\n...\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\n...\nContent-Length: 24\n...\n\nid=4' or sleep(5)#&del=1\n```\n- This injected payload will cause a 5-second delay in the MySQL query execution, multiplied by the 3 `delete` queries being executed. There is also an additional delay from the webserver, leading to a ~30 second total delay, confirming the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than what is usually in a CVE description, and includes a code snippet, a full proof of concept, and also provides the context of the vulnerable application.",

The **SQL Injection** vulnerability is directly caused by **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 description. CWE-89 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89)\n2.  **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data modification, deletion, and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis clearly points to CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **SQL Injection**, and the provided code snippet and proof of concept confirm that the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, leading to the vulnerability. The confidence level is high due to the explicit nature of the vulnerability and the supporting evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1455.94\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
