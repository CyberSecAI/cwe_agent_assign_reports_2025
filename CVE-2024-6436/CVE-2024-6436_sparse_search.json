  "query": "An input validation vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation Sequence ManagerTM which could allow a malicious user to send malformed packets to the server and cause a denial-of-service condition. If exploited, the device would become unresponsive, and a manual restart will be required for recovery. Additionally, if exploited, there could be a loss of view for the downstream equipment sequences in the controller. Users would not be able to view the status or command the equipment sequences, however the equipment sequence would continue to execute uninterrupted.",
