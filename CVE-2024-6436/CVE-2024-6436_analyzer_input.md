# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6436

## Vulnerability Description
An **input validation vulnerability** exists in the Rockwell Automation Sequence ManagerTM which could allow a malicious user to send malformed packets to the server and cause a denial-of-service condition. If exploited, the device would become unresponsive, and a manual restart will be required for recovery. Additionally, if exploited, there could be a loss of view for the downstream equipment sequences in the controller. Users would not be able to view the status or command the equipment sequences, however the equipment sequence would continue to execute uninterrupted.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **input validation vulnerability**
- **impact:** denial-of-service
- **vector:** malformed packets
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** Rockwell Automation Sequence ManagerTM

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Input validation vulnerability",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software does not properly validate input, allowing a malicious user to send malformed packets.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the device unresponsive and requiring a manual restart. It also results in a loss of view for downstream equipment sequences in the controller, preventing users from monitoring or controlling them, although the sequences continue to execute uninterrupted.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending malformed packets to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the server. No specific privileges or user interaction are required."
