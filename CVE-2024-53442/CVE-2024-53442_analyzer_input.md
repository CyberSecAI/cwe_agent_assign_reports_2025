# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53442

## Vulnerability Description
whapa v1.59 is vulnerable to Command Injection via a crafted filename to the HTML reports component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** whapa
- **version:** v1.59
- **component:** HTML reports component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-53442.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of filenames when opening HTML reports in Whapa on Linux systems. Specifically, the application passes the filename directly to `os.system('xdg-open "{}"'.format(self.path))`, which allows for command injection via a specially crafted filename.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input passed to `os.system`.
- Insufficient input validation before executing shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the victim's system.
- In the provided proof of concept, an attacker can create an arbitrary file ("exploit.txt"), demonstrating the ability to execute attacker-controlled commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted filename is created by the attacker.
- The user then selects "Open Report" and chooses the malicious file.
- The application, without sanitizing the input, passes the malicious filename to `os.system` leading to command injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a file with a specific crafted name that includes shell commands.
- The user of the Whapa application needs to select the malicious file using the "Open Report" functionality.
- The user must be using a Linux system for the `xdg-open` command to be executed via `os.system` in a way that is exploitable.
