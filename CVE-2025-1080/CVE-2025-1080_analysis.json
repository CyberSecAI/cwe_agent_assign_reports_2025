  "description": "LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme vnd.libreoffice.command specific to LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice a link in a browser using that scheme could be constructed with an embedded inner URL that when passed to LibreOffice could call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.8 before < 24.8.5, from 25.2 before < 25.2.1.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1080 based on provided content:\n\nThis content is directly relevant to CVE-2025-1080. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nLibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes for browser integration with MS SharePoint. A specific scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' was added.  A crafted link using this scheme could embed an inner URL that allowed calling internal macros with arbitrary arguments.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Macro URL arbitrary script execution:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary scripts through macros via a specially crafted URL.\n*   **Insecure URI Scheme Handling:** The 'vnd.libreoffice.command' scheme was not properly secured, allowing for malicious URL construction.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows for arbitrary script execution within LibreOffice, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A malicious link using the 'vnd.libreoffice.command' scheme can be sent to a user.\n*   When the user opens the link in a browser, the embedded URL is passed to LibreOffice, triggering the macro execution.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the correct format.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver this URL to the victim (e.g., via email, website, etc.).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in LibreOffice versions 24.8.5 and 25.2.1.\n*   The fix blocks the circumvention, preventing the execution of macros via the malicious URL.\n*   **Recommendation:** Upgrade to LibreOffice >= 24.8.5 or 25.2.1.\n\n**Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It explains the specific mechanism of the vulnerability (Office URI Schemes, 'vnd.libreoffice.command'), the root cause, and the exact versions where the fix is available. It also credits the researchers who discovered and fixed the issue.",

CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is a more specific type of code injection that involves template engines, and it is a child of CWE-94.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted link containing an embedded inner URL. This URL, when processed by LibreOffice, allows calling internal macros with arbitrary arguments. This leads to arbitrary script execution. Therefore the chain is: crafted link -> **Improper Control of Generation of Code** -> Arbitrary script execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), which directly aligns with the vulnerability description that states \"a link in a browser using that scheme could be constructed with an embedded inner URL that when passed to LibreOffice could call internal macros with arbitrary arguments\". This describes a scenario where external input (the crafted URL) is used to generate and execute code (internal macros) without proper neutralization.\n\nCWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) was also considered because the description mentions \"arbitrary arguments\", which could be related to template injection, however there is no explicit mention of a template engine being used, so it is a secondary candidate.\n\nI have opted for CWE-94 as the primary as it represents the root cause that an attacker can inject code without proper control. It is at the class level, with no base or variant level vulnerability identified.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
