# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1080

## Vulnerability Description
LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme vnd.libreoffice.command specific to LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice a link in a browser using that scheme could be constructed with an embedded inner URL that when passed to LibreOffice could call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.8 before < 24.8.5, from 25.2 before < 25.2.1.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1080 based on provided content:

This content is directly relevant to CVE-2025-1080. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes for browser integration with MS SharePoint. A specific scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' was added.  A crafted link using this scheme could embed an inner URL that allowed calling internal macros with arbitrary arguments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Macro URL arbitrary script execution:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary scripts through macros via a specially crafted URL.
*   **Insecure URI Scheme Handling:** The 'vnd.libreoffice.command' scheme was not properly secured, allowing for malicious URL construction.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The vulnerability allows for arbitrary script execution within LibreOffice, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious link using the 'vnd.libreoffice.command' scheme can be sent to a user.
*   When the user opens the link in a browser, the embedded URL is passed to LibreOffice, triggering the macro execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the correct format.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver this URL to the victim (e.g., via email, website, etc.).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in LibreOffice versions 24.8.5 and 25.2.1.
*   The fix blocks the circumvention, preventing the execution of macros via the malicious URL.
*   **Recommendation:** Upgrade to LibreOffice >= 24.8.5 or 25.2.1.
