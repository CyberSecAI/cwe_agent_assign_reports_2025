## Vulnerability Description
GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 9.3.0 and prior to version 10.0.17, an authenticated user can use the API to take control of any user that have the same or a lower level of privileges. Version 10.0.17 contains a patch for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** take control of any user that have the same or lower privileges
- **vector:** use the API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the GLPI API that allows an authenticated user to take control of another user's account, even if the target user has the same or lower privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control in the API.
- Insufficient privilege checks when performing actions through the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain complete control over another user's account, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, and disruption of services.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High, due to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Integrity Impact:** High, due to the ability to modify data and system settings.
- **Availability Impact:** None

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the GLPI API.
- It can be exploited over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GLPI system.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges other than being a regular user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.6.
- The vulnerability was patched in GLPI version 10.0.17.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-284: Improper Access Control.
- The vulnerability allows for account takeover without requiring privilege escalation.

**CVSS Vector:**
CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privileges & Permissions

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
