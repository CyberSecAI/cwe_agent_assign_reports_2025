It has a hierarchical relationship with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is also a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-863. CWE-285 is broader, while CWE-863 is more specific, indicating that the authorization check is present but flawed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **access permission verification vulnerability**. This leads to **incorrect authorization**, and ultimately affects the availability of the system (denial of service).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary decision to map to CWE-863 is based on the vulnerability description indicating an \"**Access permission verification vulnerability**.\" The \"Privileges vs Permissions Guidance\" helps clarify that this is most likely related to authorization. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is chosen because the authorization check is present but incorrectly implemented. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is broader, the specificity of the vulnerability suggests that authorization is happening, but incorrectly, thus leading to CWE-863. The evidence supporting this is the \"Access permission verification vulnerability\" phrase and the CVE summary mentioning \"Improper access permission verification.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
