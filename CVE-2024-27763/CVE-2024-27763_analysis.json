This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation in handling environment variables used for CUDA device setup.\n\nVulnerability Details:\n\n* CVE-ID: CVE-2024-27763\n* CVSS Score: (Pending assessment)\n* Impact: Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or denial of service.\n\nAffected Versions:\n\n* BasicSR versions 1.4.2 and earlier.\n\nVulnerability Description:\nThe vulnerability arises from the following code snippet located in `basicsr/utils/dist_util.py`:\n\n```\nproc_id = int(os.environ['SLURM_PROCID'])\nntasks = int(os.environ['SLURM_NTASKS'])\nnode_list = os.environ['SLURM_NODELIST']\nnum_gpus = torch.cuda.device_count()\ntorch.cuda.set_device(proc_id % num_gpus)\naddr = subprocess.getoutput(f'scontrol show hostname {node_list} | head -n1')\n```\n\nThe `scontrol show hostname {node_list}` command retrieves the hostname from the SLURM controller based on the `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable. The retrieved hostname is then used in subsequent operations without proper validation, allowing for potential command injection if `node_list` contains maliciously crafted input.\n\nMitigation:\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n* Input Validation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization of environment variables, especially those derived from external commands or user-controlled inputs.\n* Command Execution Safeguards: Avoid using unvalidated inputs directly in command execution functions like `subprocess.getoutput`.\n* Update: Upgrade to the latest version of BasicSR where this vulnerability has been patched.\n\nReferences:\n\n* GitHub Repository: [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR)\n* Commit: [8d56e3a045f9fb3e1d8872f92ee4a4f07f886b0a](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR/blob/8d56e3a045f9fb3e1d8872f92ee4a4f07f886b0a/basicsr/utils/dist_util.py#L39C1-L44C82)\n```\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in handling the `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable when used in the `scontrol show hostname` command.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**  A local attacker can craft a malicious `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable to inject commands into the `scontrol show hostname` command.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system running BasicSR.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n* Implement strict input validation and sanitization of environment variables.\n* Avoid using unvalidated inputs directly in command execution functions.\n* Upgrade to the latest version of BasicSR.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which was a placeholder).",

A secondary CWE to consider is CWE-184, **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**, which could be a prerequisite to CWE-78. The program fails to adequately validate the `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable, which is then used in a command, resulting in command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incomplete input validation** (**CWE-184**), followed by the **improper neutralization** of special elements (**CWE-78**), leading to arbitrary code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs, allows for malicious input to reach a vulnerable point in the code.\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-78, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command, results in command injection due to the unvalidated input.\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is CWE-78, as the code directly uses an unvalidated environment variable in a system command, leading to OS Command Injection. The vulnerability description and the provided code snippet clearly demonstrate that the **lack of proper input validation** allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. The **insufficient input validation** of the `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable when used in the `scontrol show hostname` command is the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is strongly supported by the evidence provided, particularly the vulnerability description and the code snippet. The description clearly states that the `scontrol show hostname {node_list}` command retrieves the hostname from the SLURM controller based on the `SLURM_NODELIST` environment variable, and this is then used without proper validation, allowing for potential command injection if `node_list` contains maliciously crafted input.\n\nCWE-184 is included as a secondary concern because the **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** is the reason the malicious input was used in the OS command.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
