  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-31135 Analysis\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-31135. It details a vulnerability in the `go-guerrilla` library that allows a client to spoof its IP address when the proxy protocol is enabled. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `PROXY` command is accepted multiple times, allowing subsequent invocations to override earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports a single initial `PROXY` header.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper input validation: The server doesn't properly restrict the number of `PROXY` commands it accepts.\n*   Reliance on client-provided data: The server trusts the IP address provided in subsequent `PROXY` commands.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   IP address spoofing: An attacker can spoof the `RemoteIP` field, potentially impacting logging, access control, or other security measures that rely on the client's IP address. The impact is considered limited, but could be more significant depending on how the `RemoteIP` is used.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending multiple `PROXY` commands to a vulnerable server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.\n*   Ability to send crafted `PROXY` commands: The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted `PROXY` commands.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version 1.6.7.\n*   The commit 7673947 prevents IP address spoofing with the PROXY command.\n*   Disabling `ProxyOn` in the configuration file if a reverse proxy is not being used.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides details about the format of the `PROXY` header and why it's being treated incorrectly.\n*   It explains the potential impact on an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) versus a web server.\n*   It includes a CVSS score (5.3/10) and a breakdown of the CVSS v3 base metrics.\n*   It mentions a planned unit test to serve as a Proof of Concept (PoC).\n*   The content details the changes made in the fix, including reading the PROXY header only once and validating the IP address.\n*   The content also includes a test case that verifies the fix.",

CWE-923 is a class-level CWE, and while related, it's more general. The vulnerability involves incorrectly specifying the destination, which aligns directly with CWE-941. CWE-923 represents a broader class of issues related to communication channels, but CWE-941 is more precise.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    \n    cwe941 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe941 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the server **incorrectly specifying the destination** in the communication channel (CWE-941). This leads to the server accepting multiple PROXY commands and trusting client-provided IP addresses, resulting in the ability to **spoof the IP address**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the fact that the `PROXY` command is accepted multiple times, which allows subsequent invocations to override earlier ones, so the client is free to send further `PROXY` commands with whatever data it pleases and the go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to **spoof its IP address.**\n\nThe selection of CWE-941 is justified by the fact that the server **incorrectly specifies the destination** in the communication channel. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the PROXY command is accepted multiple times, with later invocations overriding earlier ones. This means the server is not correctly ensuring that the communication is coming from the intended endpoint (the reverse proxy). The evidence is \"when ProxyOn is enabled, the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times, with later invocations overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address.\"\n\nCWE-941 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrectly specified destination** issue.
