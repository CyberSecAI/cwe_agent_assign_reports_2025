  "description": "ruby-saml provides security assertion markup language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) for Ruby. An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may lead to authentication bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 contain a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "```text\nHere's an analysis of the provided content based on CVE-2025-25292:\n\n**1. Does the content relate to the CVE?**\n\nYES. The content explicitly mentions CVE-2025-25292 and describes a vulnerability in the `ruby-saml` library related to SAML authentication.\n\n**2. Relevant content extraction:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a \"parser differential\" in the `ruby-saml` library. This means that ReXML and Nokogiri, the two XML parsers used by the library, interpret XML documents differently. This discrepancy allows for the construction of a \"Signature Wrapping\" attack.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Authentication bypass via Signature Wrapping\n    *   The use of ReXML and Nokogiri XML parsers in the same code path.\n    *   The handling of XML namespaces.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass SAML authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access. This could lead to account takeover.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   An attacker with access to a valid signed SAML document from the IdP could authenticate as another valid user within the environment's SAML IdP.\n    *   The attack involves manipulating the SAML document structure to exploit the parser differential.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Access to a valid signed SAML document from the Identity Provider (IdP).\n    *   Knowledge of how to construct a malicious SAML document.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Upgrade to `ruby-saml` version 1.18.0 or later.\n    *   For GitLab instances, upgrade to GitLab CE/EE versions 17.7.7, 17.8.5, or 17.9.2\n\n**3. Does the content provide more detail than the official CVE description?**\n\nYES. The content provides significant technical detail, including:\n\n*   Detailed explanation of the parser differential and how it is exploited.\n*   Specific code examples illustrating the vulnerability.\n*   Detailed explanation of the attack process\n*   Includes information on the CVSS score and EPSS score of the vulnerability\n```",

CWE-347 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the root cause. CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, representing a broader category of authentication failures.
