# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-25292

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability stems from the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** due to parser differences. |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. Authentication is bypassed as a result of the signature wrapping. |
| CWE-611 | Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Parser differences may cause external entity references, but there is not sufficient evidence. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** (CWE-347), which can lead to **improper authentication** (CWE-287). CWE-347 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the root cause. CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, representing a broader category of authentication failures. CWE-611 is a base level that may be present due to XML processing, but is not evident.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Parser differential** between ReXML and Nokogiri leading to different document structures (Implicit).
2.  **Weakness:** **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** (CWE-347).
3.  **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Signature Wrapping attack.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis concludes that the primary CWE is CWE-347 (**Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**), with a high confidence score of 0.9. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states, "The vulnerability is due to a 'parser differential' in the `ruby-saml` library... This discrepancy allows for the construction of a 'Signature Wrapping' attack." This leads to the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**, which is the root cause of the authentication bypass.

CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) is considered a secondary candidate, with a confidence score of 0.7, because it represents the impact of the **improper signature verification**. While the ultimate result is an authentication bypass, the root cause lies in the signature verification process.

CWE-611 (**Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**) was also considered since parser differences may allow external entity references, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the presence of this vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-347 being a base-level CWE that accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
