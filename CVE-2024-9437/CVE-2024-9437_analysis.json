  "description": "SuperAGI version v0.0.14 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability exists in the resource upload request, where appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request causes the server to continuously process each character. This leads to excessive resource consumption and renders the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not require any user interaction, impacting all users of the service.",

This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** because the server continuously processes each character. The end result is a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by the server's inability to handle malformed multipart boundaries in resource upload requests. The server **allocates resources without limits or throttling**, leading to excessive resource consumption and a denial-of-service condition. This is best represented by **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**. The **rootcause** \"**appending characters to multipart boundary**\" directly triggers the allocation of resources without limits.\n\nThe retriever results also suggested CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a valid high-level description of the impact, but not the root cause. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was also considered, as the multipart boundary could be viewed as a quantity. However, CWE-770 is a more precise fit for the **weakness** where resources are allocated without any size limit.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-400: While this is the impact, it's too high-level and doesn't describe the root cause. The mapping guidance discourages its use.\n*   CWE-1284: This is relevant, as the boundary could be viewed as a quantity, but CWE-770 captures the essence of the problem more directly.\n*   CWE-1333: This is related to inefficient algorithms but doesn't apply as the vulnerability isn't caused by a regular expression.\n*   CWE-20: Too generic.\n*   CWE-306: Authentication is not the primary issue. The vulnerability occurs even without authentication.\n*   CWE-401: Memory is not explicitly leaked.\n*   CWE-74: This is about injection and doesn't fit the description.\n*   CWE-434: The vulnerability is not about the type of file uploaded.\n*   CWE-73: The file name is not the issue.",
