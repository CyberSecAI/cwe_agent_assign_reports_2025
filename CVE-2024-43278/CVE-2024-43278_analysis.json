Since the description specifically mentions **improper neutralization** leading to Cross-Site Scripting, CWE-79 was chosen as the root cause. The other CWEs were not specific enough to the vulnerability being described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of input. This leads directly to the impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the root cause is **improper neutralization** leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The key phrase \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\" aligns directly with CWE-79.\n\nThe description states: \"**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** (XSS or Cross-site Scripting) vulnerability in Phi Phan Meta Field Block allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Meta Field Block from n/a through 1.2.13.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-79 is a parent to more specific XSS variants like CWE-80. However, since the description does not specify which type of neutralization is missing, choosing CWE-79 is the most appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not using*: Although CWE-80 is a variant of CWE-79, the description doesn't specifically mention HTML tag neutralization issues.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not using*: This CWE is not specific to XSS.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Reason for not using*: This is a high-level class and not specific to XSS.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
