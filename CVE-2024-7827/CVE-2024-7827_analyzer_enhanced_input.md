## Vulnerability Description
The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to boolean-based SQL Injection via the model_number parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 5.7.2
- **component:** model_number parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-7827:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, particularly the Wordfence analysis, explicitly mentions "Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store <= 5.7.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) SQL Injection via model\_number Parameter" and links it to CVE-2024-7827. This confirms the content is directly relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `model_number` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query doesn't use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Specifically, boolean-based SQL injection is present. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Modification**: Attackers can potentially alter or delete information in the database

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **`model_number` Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `model_number` parameter. It's unclear from the text, but this is likely a URL parameter or a POST parameter submitted when the page is loaded.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level privileges or higher.
*   **Ability to Manipulate `model_number` Parameter:** The attacker must be able to control or manipulate the `model_number` parameter which can be done through the URL or by using POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence analysis indicates that the vulnerability is publicly known and has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, which is categorized as High severity.
*   The fix for the vulnerability is available in version 5.7.3 of the plugin, or newer.
