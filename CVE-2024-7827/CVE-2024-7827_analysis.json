  "description": "The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to boolean-based SQL Injection via the model_number parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
  "key_phrases": {
    "rootcause": "insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-7827:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided content, particularly the Wordfence analysis, explicitly mentions \"Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store <= 5.7.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) SQL Injection via model\\_number Parameter\" and links it to CVE-2024-7827. This confirms the content is directly relevant to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `model_number` parameter before using it in an SQL query.\n*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query doesn't use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** Specifically, boolean-based SQL injection is present. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.\n*   **Data Modification**: Attackers can potentially alter or delete information in the database\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **`model_number` Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `model_number` parameter. It's unclear from the text, but this is likely a URL parameter or a POST parameter submitted when the page is loaded.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level privileges or higher.\n*   **Ability to Manipulate `model_number` Parameter:** The attacker must be able to control or manipulate the `model_number` parameter which can be done through the URL or by using POST request.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The Wordfence analysis indicates that the vulnerability is publicly known and has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, which is categorized as High severity.\n*   The fix for the vulnerability is available in version 5.7.3 of the plugin, or newer.\n*   The plugin is \"Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store\", a WordPress plugin with slug 'wp-easycart'\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.",
