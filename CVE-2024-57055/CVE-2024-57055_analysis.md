# Analysis for CVE-2024-57055

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Pillar | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284, making it a more specific classification if applicable. The analysis also considered the authentication vs. authorization guidance.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Server-Side Access Control Bypass vulnerability**. The chain is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Server-Side Access Control Bypass vulnerability** due to incorrect authorization implementation on the server.
2.  **Weakness:** The server does not properly check the authorization level of the user.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized users can potentially call certain services without the necessary access level.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary decision to use CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is based on the description of the **Server-Side Access Control Bypass vulnerability**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that access controls were in place on the client-side, but a vulnerability existed on the server-side that allowed unauthorized users to call certain services. This indicates that the authorization check, if present, was implemented incorrectly.

The Mapping Discussion guidance, specifically the Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control section, helps distinguish between authentication and authorization issues. Since the vulnerability involves unauthorized access to services, it is an authorization issue, not an authentication issue. The analysis also considered the Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification guidance, confirming that the issue is related to how access is granted *after* a user has been identified, which points to an authorization problem.

CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered as a potential alternative, but it is a higher-level category that should only be used when the root cause is unclear. Since the root cause is identified as an authorization issue (incorrect implementation), CWE-863 is more appropriate.

The retriever results also listed CWE-863 as a relevant CWE. The retriever scores serve as supporting evidence for this decision.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the Authentication Algorithm is not the root cause.*

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about data authenticity.*

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about path equivalence.*

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about external control of assumed-immutable web parameters.*

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about authentication bypass.*

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about exposure of resources.*

## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about client-side enforcement.*

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about weak authentication.*

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about improper check for unusual conditions.*

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not about reliance on untrusted input.*

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
