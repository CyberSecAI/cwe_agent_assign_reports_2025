  "query": "A vulnerability in Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and modify data in a repository that belongs to an internal service of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient enforcement of access control on HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.",
