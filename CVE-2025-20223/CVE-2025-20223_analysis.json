  "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and modify data in a repository that belongs to an internal service of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient enforcement of access control on HTTP requests**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.",

CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a peer of CWE-863. The selection of CWE-863 is based on the fact that an authorization check exists, but it is performed incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -- PEEROF --> cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient enforcement of access control on HTTP requests** (CWE-863), leading to the impact of an attacker being able to read and modify data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**insufficient enforcement of access control on HTTP requests**\". This points to a problem with authorization, since authentication would have occurred before an attacker could craft HTTP requests. The choice between CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) hinges on whether an authorization check is present but flawed, or entirely missing. Because the vulnerability description states that there is \"**insufficient enforcement**\", there is an authorization check present, but it is implemented incorrectly. Therefore, CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-862. The evidence supporting this decision is found in the vulnerability description: \"**insufficient enforcement of access control on HTTP requests**\". This assessment is based on the provided evidence, and the CWE graph relationships support the selection of CWE-863 as the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
