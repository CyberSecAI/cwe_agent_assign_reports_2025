This is only possible if * ozone.s3g.secret.http.enabled is set to true. The default value of this configuration is false. * The user configured in ozone.s3g.kerberos.principal is also configured in ozone.s3.administrators or ozone.administrators. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Ozone version 1.4.1 which disables the affected endpoint.",

Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper authentication** due to a missing authentication check, CWE-306, being a more specific child of CWE-287, was chosen. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered due to potential authorization issues, but ultimately the root cause was determined to be a complete lack of authentication for a critical function, pointing towards CWE-306 as the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authentication** check on an HTTP endpoint (CWE-306). This allows any authenticated Kerberos user to then perform unauthorized actions, specifically revoking and regenerating S3 secrets of other users. The ability to revoke and regenerate secrets without proper authentication can be viewed as leading to potential unauthorized access or denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description explicitly states \"**Improper authentication** of an HTTP endpoint\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by mentioning \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication\". Given this evidence, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was selected as the primary CWE. This selection is further supported by the guidance provided for Authentication vs. Authorization, which states that CWE-306 is used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the primary issue is the **lack of authentication** rather than an incorrect authorization check. If authentication were present and flawed, CWE-863 would have been a more suitable choice.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was also considered since the impact is the ability to revoke and regenerate secrets but the root cause is the missing authentication.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-306 directly addresses the root cause: the complete **lack of authentication** for a critical function.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
