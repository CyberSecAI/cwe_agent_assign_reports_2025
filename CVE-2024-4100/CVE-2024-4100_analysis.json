  "description": "The Pricing Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on the ajax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of actions related to managing pricing tables via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4100\n\n**Description:** The Pricing Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in versions up to and including 2.0.1.\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ajax()` function of the plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The plugin's `ajax()` function lacks proper nonce validation, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   An unauthenticated attacker can potentially perform actions related to managing pricing tables. This includes adding, updating, removing and restoring pricing table data.\n*   Successful exploitation could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized modifications of pricing tables, or even denial of service for legitimate users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attack vector is through a forged request to the plugin's AJAX endpoint (`wp_ajax_` + slug + `_widgets_api`).\n*   The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action that triggers the malicious request. This can be done by enticing the administrator to click a crafted link.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request.\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack but needs a logged-in administrator to inadvertently trigger the request.\n*   The attacker needs to find a way to get the admin to click a link or load a malicious page that initiates the request.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `widgets-api.php` file within the plugin.\n*   The specific method that is vulnerable is the `ajax()` function.\n*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 8, 2024.\n*   The plugin version affected is <= 2.0.1.\n*   There is no known patch available.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the basic CVE description which is a placeholder.",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the identified issue is a CSRF vulnerability due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is considered as a secondary weakness because the **missing nonce validation** effectively leads to a missing authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing or incorrect nonce validation** which allows an attacker to forge requests, leading to unauthorized actions being performed.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing or incorrect nonce validation**\nWeakness: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)\nImpact: Unauthorized actions related to managing pricing tables.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the explicit mention of **Cross-Site Request Forgery** and the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a CSRF vulnerability due to the **lack of nonce validation** on the `ajax()` function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to perform actions by tricking a site administrator.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-352 as a strong candidate. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-352 is directly related to the described vulnerability.\n\nCWE-862 is a potential secondary issue because the **lack of nonce validation** can be interpreted as a form of missing authorization. The attacker is able to perform actions because the application **does not properly authorize** the requests.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a Compound weakness that accurately represents the CSRF vulnerability and CWE-862 being a Class that highlights the missing authorization aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
