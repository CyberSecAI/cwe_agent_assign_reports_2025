The document explains that since APIC release 5.2(1) and ACI switch release 15.2(1), ACI switches automatically upgrade the FPGA/EPLD/BIOS during bootup for leaf switches and box-type spine switches, along with the supervisor, linecard, and fabric modules in modular-type spine switches. The upgrade process involves comparing the BIOS and EPLD/FPGA versions and initiating an upgrade followed by power cycling the component if needed.

The vulnerability stems from the bootloader failing to properly verify the cryptographic signature of the NX-OS image, which is a direct match for this CWE. |\n| CWE-1274 | Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.  This CWE is related as the bootloader is in volatile memory and access to it is not properly controlled. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match between the vulnerability description and **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)**. This CWE's focus on signature verification aligns directly with the described vulnerability where the bootloader **fails to properly verify the NX-OS image signature**. **CWE-1274 (Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code)** is a child of **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**, representing a broader category. While the bootloader exists in volatile memory, the core issue is signature verification, making **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)** a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe1274[\"CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1274 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe1274 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure bootloader settings**, leading to **improper verification of the NX-OS image signature (CWE-347)**. This allows an attacker to **bypass the signature verification** and **load unverified software**, which ultimately compromises the device's integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selection, **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)**, is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **insecure bootloader settings** that allow an attacker to **bypass NX-OS image signature verification and load unverified software**. The CVE reference links confirm this, stating the **root cause** is **insecure bootloader settings** and a **lack of proper image signature verification**. This direct alignment makes **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)** the most appropriate choice. While other CWEs like **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** and **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** were considered, they represent broader categories and are less specific than **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)**. **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)** is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

The advisory doesn't suggest there's an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm, but rather that the bootloader settings are **insecure**.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis was considered but rejected.

This is too generic for the **rootcause**.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis was considered but rejected. The advisory doesn't suggest there's an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm, but rather that the bootloader settings are **insecure**.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis was considered but rejected. The advisory does not suggest a privilege issue.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis was considered but rejected. This does not apply.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2792.84\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-1391:**\n- 1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-280:**\n- 280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges ) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",

However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.\n\n\nConsider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. \n\n\nAlternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security. \n",
