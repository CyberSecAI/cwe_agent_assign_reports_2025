The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"Missing Authorization vulnerability\"** as the root cause. CWE-79 is a separate weakness that is a result of the **missing authorization**, thus both weaknesses are independent of each other but present in the same product, version.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79-.->|EXPLOITATION REQUIRES|cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862). Because of the **missing authorization**, an attacker can inject malicious input that is not neutralized, leading to **Cross-Site Scripting** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause. The vulnerability description clearly states **\"Missing Authorization vulnerability\"**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by stating, \"A **missing authorization**, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.\"\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The product does not perform an authorization check, allowing unauthorized actions.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is a secondary CWE. This vulnerability is a result of **missing authorization** which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the Class level due to the absence of specific details pointing to a more granular Base-level CWE. However, it is still the most appropriate given the information provided. CWE-79 is at the Base level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
