  "description": "CIE.AspNetCore.Authentication is an AspNetCore Remote Authenticator for CIE 3.0. Authentication using Spid and CIE is based on the SAML2 standard which provides two entities 1. Identity Provider (IDP) the system that authenticates users and provides identity information (SAML affirmation) to the Service Provider, in essence, is responsible for the management of the credentials and identity of users 2. Service Provider (SP) the system that provides a service to the user and relies on the Identity Provider to authenticate the user, receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. The library cie-aspnetcore refers to the second entity, the SP, and implements the validation logic of SAML assertions within SAML responses. In affected versions there is no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object, it follows that if an attacker injects an item signed as the first element, all other signatures will not be verified. The only requirement is to have an XML element legitimately signed by the IdP, a condition that is easily met using the IdPs public metadata. An attacker could create an arbitrary SAML response that would be accepted by SPs using vulnerable SDKs, allowing him to impersonate any Spid and/or CIE user. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-24895 - SAML Response Signature Verification Bypass in CIE.AspNetCore.Authentication\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the way the `cie-aspnetcore` library validates SAML responses. It only verifies the first signature found in the XML document, without ensuring it covers the entire response. An attacker can inject a validly signed XML element before the main SAML response, causing the library to only validate the injected signature and ignore the rest of the response, including potentially malicious assertions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insufficient signature validation in SAML response processing.\n*   Failure to verify all signatures within the SAML response.\n*   Reliance on the order of signatures in the XML document.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can create a crafted SAML response with arbitrary assertions and successfully impersonate any SPID/CIE user. This allows unauthorized access to resources protected by the application.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the SAML response during transit (e.g., using a man-in-the-middle attack or by compromising a system that generates or relays SAML responses).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to obtain a valid XML signature from a trusted IdP. This can be achieved by reading the publicly available metadata of the IdP.\n*   The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify the SAML response.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Verify *all* signatures present in the SAML response, not just the first one.\n*   Ensure that the signatures cover the entire SAML response, including all assertions.\n*   Do not rely on the order of signatures in the XML document.\n\n**Severity:**\n\nCritical (CVSS score: 9.1/10)\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n<= 2.0.4\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n2.1.0\n\n**Additional details:**\n\nThe content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including code snippets, a proof-of-concept (PoC), and references to relevant security resources. It provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain.",

It is related to the class-level CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) as its child. CWE-287 and CWE-1390 are class-level CWEs related to authentication issues. CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1390 is a parent of CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm), but these are not selected because the issue isn't a complete lack of authentication, but an improper validation of the signature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe347 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe287\n    cwe347 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). This leads to a bypass of authentication (CWE-287, CWE-1390), ultimately resulting in the ability to impersonate users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** within the SAML response, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication and impersonate users. The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which explicitly states that the root cause is the insufficient signature validation in SAML response processing.\n\n> **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n>\n> The vulnerability lies in the way the `cie-aspnetcore` library validates SAML responses.
