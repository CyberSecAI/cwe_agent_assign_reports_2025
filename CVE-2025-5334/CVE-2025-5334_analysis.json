CWE-285 is a class-level CWE and represents a broader category of authorization issues. The relationship between CWE-359 and CWE-200 helps to understand the hierarchical structure, where the exposure of private personal information is a specific type of information exposure. Selecting CWE-359 provides a more specific classification than using the more general CWE-200. The authorization issue is a secondary concern because the main problem is the unintended movement of data, which leads to exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the unintentional movement of entries from user vaults to shared vaults. This **incorrect** data placement leads to **exposure** of private personal information to unauthorized users.\n\nUnintentional Data Movement -> **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285) -> **Exposure of Private Personal Information** (CWE-359)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, providing high confidence. The primary vulnerability is the **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359) due to the unintended movement of entries. This is a direct consequence of a potential **improper authorization** issue (CWE-285), which is considered a secondary factor because the root cause is the data movement, not the authorization mechanism itself. The selection of CWE-359 is justified by the direct impact of the vulnerability, as stated in the description: \"an authenticated user can gain unauthorized access to private personal information.\" While CWE-200 was suggested, it was too general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
