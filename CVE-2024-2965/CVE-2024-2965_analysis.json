  "description": "A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent **infinite recursion** when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.",

While more specific Base-level CWEs exist, the description clearly points to the lack of control over recursion as the root cause. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a related Class-level CWE and represents the impact of the uncontrolled recursion. CWE-674 can lead to CWE-400. The relationships are as follows:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe674\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674) in the `parse_sitemap` method.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is \"Uncontrolled recursion in sitemap parsing\". The vulnerability description clearly states this **infinite recursion** can \"crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python\", causing a denial of service.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-674, which is a Class level CWE, as the best candidate and the description matches. The retriever also listed CWE-835 \"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\" which is not correct since it's recursion and not a loop.\n\nCWE-400, which represents uncontrolled resource consumption, is selected as a secondary CWE to describe the impact of the vulnerability, which can cause denial of service.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-674 accurately represents the root cause, and CWE-400 effectively captures the resulting impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
