## Vulnerability Description
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent **infinite recursion** when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **infinite recursion**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) and availability
- **product:** langchain-ai/langchain
- **version:** all versions
- **component:** SitemapLoader class

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `SitemapLoader` in `langchain` recursively parses sitemaps without a limit, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled recursion in sitemap parsing",
      "Lack of depth limitation in sitemap traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive resource usage caused by the recursive parsing of sitemaps, particularly when a sitemap contains a large number of nested links. This could lead to program termination or significantly slow performance, as well as excessive memory consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Providing a malicious or crafted sitemap containing nested links to the `SitemapLoader`."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to control or provide the input sitemap to the `SitemapLoader`."
  },
  "additional_details": "The fix introduces a `max_depth` parameter to the `SitemapLoader`, limiting the depth to which the sitemap can be parsed. This prevents infinite or overly deep recursive calls during parsing."
}
