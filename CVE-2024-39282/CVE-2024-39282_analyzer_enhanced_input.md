## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net wwan t7xx Fix FSM command timeout issue When driver processes the internal state change command, it use an asynchronous thread to process the command operation. If the main thread detects that the task has timed out, the asynchronous thread will panic when executing the completion notification because the main thread completion object has been released. BUG unable to handle page fault for address fffffffffffffff8 PGD 1f283a067 P4D 1f283a067 PUD 1f283c067 PMD 0 Oops 0000

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
