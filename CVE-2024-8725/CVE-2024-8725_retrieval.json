  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-8725', description='Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Limited File Upload in various versions. This is due to a **lack of proper checks** to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting**. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper checks', 'weakness': ['Cross-Site Scripting', 'file upload'], 'impact': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers', 'product': 'Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress', 'version': 'various versions', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks in the Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin allows users with Subscriber-level access and above to upload certain file types (.css and .js) to arbitrary directories within the WordPress installation, provided the administrator grants them the necessary file management permissions. This violates the principle of least privilege, enabling lower-privileged users to perform actions they shouldn\\'t.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The core issue is the lack of restrictions on file uploads based on user roles. The plugin doesn\\'t properly validate if a user, other than admin, should be allowed to upload .css and .js files.\\n*   **Insufficient Role-Based Permissions:** Subscriber-level users (and potentially other low-privilege roles) are not adequately restricted from uploading files to any directory, including those used by WordPress core or other plugins.\\n*   **Lack of Sanitization:** While the plugin attempts to sanitize filenames, it\\'s not enough to prevent the upload of malicious files, specifically .css and .js, which can contain executable code.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious .css or .js files, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users visiting the site.\\n*   **Website Takeover:** In cases where the uploaded files overwrite legitimate plugin or theme files, this can enable an attacker to gain full control over the WordPress site.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Authenticated Users:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Subscriber-level access.\\n*   **File Upload:** The attacker exploits the file upload functionality of the Advanced File Manager plugin, specifically using shortcode component.\\n*   **Arbitrary Path:** The plugin allows specifying a path for file uploads, which enables an attacker to upload files to sensitive locations.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, with at least Subscriber-level privileges or above.\\n*   **Plugin Installation:** The \"Advanced File Manager Shortcodes\" plugin must be installed on the target WordPress instance and enabled.\\n*   **Admin Granted Permissions**: The administrator must provide access to file management functionality.\\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to upload the malicious files via the WordPress site interface.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The Wordfence article specifies that version 5.2.9 was released to address the vulnerability. The provided changeset diffs confirm fixes made for this vulnerability.\\n*   The vulnerability requires the \\'Advanced File Manager Shortcodes\\' plugin to be installed to be exploitable, suggesting it\\'s a vulnerability within this component.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity, due to the relatively low privilege requirement and limited ability to cause damage.\\n*   The plugin developers have implemented fixes in version 5.2.9 that prevents the upload of malicious files and adds role based restrictions to the plugin.\\n\\nThis information provides a more detailed picture of the vulnerability than the official CVE description.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {},

This is due to a **lack of proper checks** to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting**. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper checks'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
