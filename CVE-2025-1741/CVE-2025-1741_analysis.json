  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in b1gMail up to 7.4.1-pl1. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file src/admin/users.php of the component Admin Page. The manipulation of the argument query/q leads to **deserialization**. The attack can be launched remotely. Upgrading to version 7.4.1-pl2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is 4816c8b748f6a5b965c8994e2cf10861bf6e68aa. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor acted highly professional and even fixed this issue in the discontinued commercial edition as b1gMail 7.4.0-pl3.",

The vulnerability has been addressed in version 7.4.1-pl2.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nDeserialization of untrusted data via `unserialize($_REQUEST['query'])` in `src/admin/users.php` (line 228).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n*   CAPEC-586: Object Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could lead to arbitrary file deletion (demonstrated by a PoC deleting `/var/www/b1gMail/src/now_you_see_me.txt`). Other attacks are possible depending on installed plugins and available gadget chains. While the vulnerable functionality is in an admin page, access is restricted to administrators, the vulnerability *may* be exploitable via XSS/CSRF due to the use of a GET request.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A GET request to `/admin/users.php` with a malicious `query` parameter containing a serialized PHP object.\n*   Potentially via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Administrator access to the b1gMail admin interface.\n*   Knowledge of PHP object injection and available gadget chains (e.g., Smarty).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `unserialize()` with `json_decode()` in `src/admin/users.php`.\n*   Alternatively, using the `allowed_classes` option with `unserialize()` to disable object injection (if object deserialization is necessary).\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was reported by mcdruid.\n*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit using a Smarty gadget chain is provided.\n*   The vulnerable code is specifically located in `src/admin/users.php` at line 228.\n*   The fix is available in version 7.4.1-pl2: [https://github.com/b1gMail-OSS/b1gMail/releases/tag/7.4.1-pl2](https://github.com/b1gMail-OSS/b1gMail/releases/tag/7.4.1-pl2)\n*   The commit fixing the issue is: [https://github.com/b1gMail-OSS/b1gMail/commit/4816c8b748f6a5b965c8994e2cf10861bf6e68aa](https://github.com/b1gMail-OSS/b1gMail/commit/4816c8b748f6a5b965c8994e2cf10861bf6e68aa)",

There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships immediately relevant in this specific case, as the vulnerability is directly attributable to the **deserialization** of untrusted data. While CWE-502 can lead to other vulnerabilities, the description focuses solely on the **deserialization** issue itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe502 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data leading to potential arbitrary code execution or file deletion.\n\n`Untrusted Data --> Deserialization (CWE-502) --> Arbitrary Code Execution/File Deletion`\n\nThe root cause is the **deserialization** of untrusted data. The impact is arbitrary code execution or file deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is the **deserialization** of untrusted data via `unserialize($_REQUEST['query'])` in `src/admin/users.php`. The vulnerability description key phrases also point to **deserialization** as the weakness. The fix mentioned, replacing `unserialize()` with `json_decode()`, further confirms this.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-502 with a high score, supporting this selection.\n\nThe choice of CWE-502 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **deserialization** issue, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
