Thus, CWE-190 can precede CWE-125. Both are base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), resulting in local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an **integer overflow** leads to an **out-of-bounds read**. The CVE description also mentions CWE-190 as the cause.\n\nThe evidence: \"In da, there is a possible **out of bounds read** due to an **integer overflow**.\"\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions it as the root cause.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is selected as a secondary CWE as it is the weakness resulting from the integer overflow.\n\nThese selections are made based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details. Both CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing the most specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
