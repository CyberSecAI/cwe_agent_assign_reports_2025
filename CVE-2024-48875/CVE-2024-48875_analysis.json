Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock scenario, CWE-833 was chosen as the primary CWE due to its greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking**, which leads directly to a **deadlock** condition.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Locking**\n  - Impact: **Deadlock**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly suggests CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that a **deadlock** is occurring due to recursive locking, confirming the direct match with CWE-833's definition. The call trace also indicates the **recursive locking** that results in the **deadlock**.
