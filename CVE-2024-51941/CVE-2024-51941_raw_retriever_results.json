  "query": "A remote code injection vulnerability exists in the Ambari Metrics and AMS Alerts feature, allowing authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability occurs when processing alert definitions, where malicious input can be injected into the alert script execution path. An attacker with authenticated access can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The issue has been fixed in the latest versions of Ambari.",
