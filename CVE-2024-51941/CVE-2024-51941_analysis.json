  "description": "A remote code injection vulnerability exists in the Ambari Metrics and AMS Alerts feature, allowing authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability occurs when processing alert definitions, where malicious input can be injected into the alert script execution path. An attacker with authenticated access can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The issue has been fixed in the latest versions of Ambari.",

CWE-94 has parent-child relationships with CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Code Syntax) and CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')), and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine). It is also a child of CWE-913 (Insufficient Control Flow Management). CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command). The relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-94 because the vulnerability involves the **improper control of code generation**, a key characteristic of CWE-94.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe95 -->|PARENTOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of alert definitions**, leading to a **remote code injection vulnerability**. An authenticated user can then **execute arbitrary commands on the server** due to the **lack of proper neutralization of malicious input** in the script execution path.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs based on the vulnerability description and retriever results. The final conclusion is based on a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, considering the root cause, attack vector, and impact. The primary CWE is CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), as the vulnerability involves injecting and executing arbitrary code through alert definitions due to a **lack of proper neutralization**. The choice is further supported by the evidence that the vulnerability allows an attacker with authenticated access to **execute arbitrary commands on the server**.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selected CWEs is derived from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"A remote code injection vulnerability exists in the Ambari Metrics and AMS Alerts feature,\" and \"An attacker with authenticated access can execute arbitrary commands on the server.\"\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered as a secondary candidate since the impact is execution of OS commands, but the root cause is more aligned with code injection (CWE-94) where the application is generating code from the input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
