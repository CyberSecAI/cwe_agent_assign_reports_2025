## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0232 Content

This content **relates** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the 'psw' parameter in the `/successadmin.php` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'psw' parameter in a POST request to `/successadmin.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

The content provides several payload examples for different types of SQL injection attacks:

*   **Boolean-based blind:** `uname=admin&psw=123456' OR NOT 5111=5111 AND 'IWGD'='IWGD&remember=on`
*   **Error-based:** `uname=admin&psw=123456' OR (SELECT 2008 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7162717171,(SELECT (ELT(2008=2008,1))),0x71706b7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'upEN'='upEN&remember=on`
*   **Time-based blind:** `uname=admin&psw=123456' AND (SELECT 5716 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))DVry) AND 'ooec'='ooec&remember=on`

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Blood Bank Management System In PHP With Source Code
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/successadmin.php`
*   **Version:** V1.0
