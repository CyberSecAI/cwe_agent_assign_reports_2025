# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5925

## Vulnerability Description
The Theron Lite theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the url parameter within the themes Button shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `theron_button_func` function of the Theron Lite WordPress theme. This function handles the 'button' shortcode. Specifically, the `url` parameter passed to the shortcode is not properly sanitized before being used in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `url` parameter of the `button` shortcode. This injected script is then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the page containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate malware downloads.
- **Defacement:**  An attacker could modify the content of the page, causing it to be defaced.
- **Data Theft:**  An attacker could attempt to steal sensitive information that users enter on the affected page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can insert the vulnerable `button` shortcode with a malicious URL in a page or post.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `url` parameter is used directly without sanitization in the href attribute, facilitating the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access. This level of access allows the attacker to create and modify content.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerable code is located in the `theron_button_func` function in the `shortcodes.php` file:

```php
function theron_button_func($atts, $content = null) {
    extract(shortcode_atts(array('url' => 'http://www.google.com'), $atts));
    $return_html = '<div class="scl_button"><span><a href="'.$url.'">'.$content.'</a></span></div><div style="clear:both"></div>';
    return $return_html;
}
```
The `url` variable takes the user-supplied value and embeds it directly into the HTML without any sanitization or escaping.
