  "description": "A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester AC Repair and Services System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function save_users of the file /classes/Users.php. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",
