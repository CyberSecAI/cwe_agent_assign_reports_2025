  "description": "A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43 and classified as critical. This issue affects the function _bfd_elf_gc_mark_rsec of the file elflink.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named f9978defb6fab0bd8583942d97c112b0932ac814. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",

CWE-122 is more specific, indicating the overflow occurs in the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **heap-based buffer overflow** due to **improper** handling of memory boundaries.
