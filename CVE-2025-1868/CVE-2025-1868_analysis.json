It occurs when these applications initiate a network scan, inadvertently sending the NTLM hash of the user performing the scan. This vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting network traffic to a legitimate server or by setting up a fake server, in both local and remote scenarios. This exposure is relevant for both HTTP/HTTPS and SMB protocols.",

CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is too general, but it is a parent of CWE-213 which could be relevant.

The key evidence is the **unauthorized exposure of confidential information** and the fact that the application is **sending the NTLM hash of the user performing the scan**.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-201, as it is listed as a relevant CWE.
