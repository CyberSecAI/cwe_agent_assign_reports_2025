# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1868

## Vulnerability Description
Vulnerability of **unauthorized exposure of confidential information** affecting Advanced IP Scanner and Advanced Port Scanner. It occurs when these applications initiate a network scan, inadvertently sending the NTLM hash of the user performing the scan. This vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting network traffic to a legitimate server or by setting up a fake server, in both local and remote scenarios. This exposure is relevant for both HTTP/HTTPS and SMB protocols.
