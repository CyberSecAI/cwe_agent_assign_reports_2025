  "query": "Vulnerability of unauthorized exposure of confidential information affecting Advanced IP Scanner and Advanced Port Scanner. It occurs when these applications initiate a network scan, inadvertently sending the NTLM hash of the user performing the scan. This vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting network traffic to a legitimate server or by setting up a fake server, in both local and remote scenarios. This exposure is relevant for both HTTP/HTTPS and SMB protocols.",
