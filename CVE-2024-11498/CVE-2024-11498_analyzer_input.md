# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11498

## Vulnerability Description
There exists a **stack buffer overflow** in libjxl.A specifically-crafted file can cause the JPEG XL decoder to use large amounts of stack space (up to 256mb is possible, maybe 512mb), potentially exhausting the stack. An attacker can craft a file that will cause excessive memory usage. We recommend upgrading past commit65fbec56bc578b6b6ee02a527be70787bbd053b0.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2024-11498:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the recursive checking of tree property values in the libjxl library's modular tree decoding process. This recursive approach could lead to excessive stack usage when processing specifically crafted files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for stack exhaustion due to deep recursion.
- **Lack of proper input validation:** The code didn't implement sufficient checks on the height of modular trees, allowing for the construction of files that could trigger the deep recursion and large stack allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability could result in a DoS attack by causing a large stack usage, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted JXL files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted JXL image files. These files would be designed to have a modular tree structure that triggers the excessive stack usage when decoded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to supply a malicious JXL image file to a vulnerable application using the libjxl library. This could be done through various channels, such as website uploads, email attachments, or other means of file transfer.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves rewriting the implementation to use iterative checking instead of recursive checking, ensuring low stack usage.
- A height limit (`kHeightLimit = 2048`) has been added to further mitigate the issue.
- The pull request also notes that level 5 encoding had a smaller tree height limit of 64, and that the encoder might not have been enforcing the limits, and the decoder should verify the limits.
