  "cve_id": "CVE-2025-1752",
  "description": "A **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability** has been identified in the KnowledgeBaseWebReader class of the run-llama/llama_index project, affecting version ~ latest(v0.12.15). The vulnerability arises due to inappropriate secure coding measures, specifically the lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter in the get_article_urls function. This allows an attacker to exhaust Pythons recursion limit through repeated function calls, leading to resource consumption and ultimately crashing the Python process.",

If it does, the function returns, preventing further recursion.\n- A print statement was added to indicate when the maximum depth is reached.\n- The version was updated to 0.3.6.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, as it includes the specific code changes and the reasoning behind them.",

While it would be ideal to have a more specific Base-level CWE, the description aligns well with the concept of uncontrolled recursion leading to resource exhaustion. CWE-674 is a child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). CWE-400 is also a parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    \n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter** in the `get_article_urls` function, leading to **Uncontrolled Recursion (CWE-674)**. This then results in **resource consumption** and ultimately a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. CWE-674 leads to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE reference links. The **root cause** is the **lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter**, which allows uncontrolled recursion. This aligns well with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-674 as a potential candidate, further supporting the decision. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a related CWE, it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also a possible CWE, but it is less specific than CWE-674 in this context.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Class level of abstraction. While a more specific Base-level CWE would be ideal, CWE-674 accurately represents the weakness based on the available evidence.
