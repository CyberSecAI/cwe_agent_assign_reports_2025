## Vulnerability Description
Multiple OS **command injection vulnerabilities** exist in the internet.cgi set_add_routing() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.A command injection vulnerability exists in the `netmask` POST parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection vulnerabilities**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **vector:** specially crafted HTTP request
- **product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8
- **version:** V5030.210505
- **component:** internet.cgi set_add_routing() functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements within the `set_add_routing()` function of the `internet.cgi` file. Specifically, the `netmask`, `gateway`, `dest` and `custom_interface` parameters are directly incorporated into commands executed via `popen` without proper input validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command Injection (CWE-77) vulnerabilities exist in the following parameters:
  - netmask (CVE-2024-39762)
  - gateway (CVE-2024-39763)
  - dest (CVE-2024-39764)
  - custom_interface (CVE-2024-39765)

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary command execution is possible.

Attack vectors:
- An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP POST request to the `internet.cgi` file with the `page=addrouting` parameter and crafted values for the vulnerable parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be authenticated.

Mitigation or fix:
- The vendor is working on patches, but the product has been discontinued.
