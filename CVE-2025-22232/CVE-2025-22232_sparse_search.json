  "query": "Spring Cloud Config Server may not use Vault token sent by clients using a X-CONFIG-TOKEN header when making requests to Vault. Your application may be affected by this if the following are true * You have Spring Vault on the classpath of your Spring Cloud Config Server and * You are using the X-CONFIG-TOKEN header to send a Vault token to the Spring Cloud Config Server for the Config Server to use when making requests to Vault and * You are using the default Spring Vault SessionManager implementation LifecycleAwareSessionManager or a SessionManager implementation that persists the Vault token such as SimpleSessionManager. In this case the SessionManager persists the first token it retrieves and will continue to use that token even if client requests to the Spring Cloud Config Server include a X-CONFIG-TOKEN header with a different value. Affected Spring Products and Versions Spring Cloud Config * 2.2.1.RELEASE - 4.2.1 Mitigation Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.
