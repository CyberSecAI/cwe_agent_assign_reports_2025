CWE-304 is at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe304[\"CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    \n    cwe304 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe347\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe304 primary\n    class cwe347 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing critical step** in the authentication process (CWE-304). This can lead to **improper verification of cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), potentially bypassing user throttling. The root cause is the **missing critical step**, and the impact is the user throttling bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and key phrases. The description mentions a cryptographic issue during PIN/password verification using Gatekeeper. The key phrase highlights that it is related to PIN/password verification using Gatekeeper and that the impact is user throttling bypass.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-304 [Missing Critical Step in Authentication] because the vulnerability description mentions that \"RPMB writes can be dropped on verification failure\". This indicates a **missing** step in the authentication process, which aligns with CWE-304. The abstraction level is Base, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] is considered a secondary candidate because the description mentions \"Cryptographic issue occurs during PIN/password verification\". This suggests a problem with the cryptographic signature verification process, making CWE-347 relevant.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] and CWE-1390 [Weak Authentication], but they are Class-level CWEs and less specific than CWE-304, which directly addresses the **missing critical step** in the authentication process. CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer] and CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read] were considered, but they don't directly relate to the authentication process described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-288:
