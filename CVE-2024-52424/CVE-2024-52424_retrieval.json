This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests.\\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions, effectively taking over some functionality of the plugin. The specific impact will depend on the actions the plugin allows.\\n*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector is through crafted web requests, typically sent via a link or embedded in a website or email, to trick the logged-in administrator into performing an action they did not intend to perform.\\n*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to initiate the malicious request.\\n\\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable plugin, the version number and the fact that there is no official fix available. It also includes the Patchstack virtual patch solution.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Suresh Kumar wp-login customizer', 'keyphrase': 'Suresh Kumar wp-login customizer', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(313.4516645145264)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Suresh Kumar wp-login customizer', 'keyphrase': 'Suresh Kumar wp-login customizer', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(228.72458051794996)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(196.27474396249596)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
