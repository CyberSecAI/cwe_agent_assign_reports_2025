# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-32390

## Vulnerability Description
EspoCRM is a free, open-source customer relationship management platform. Prior to version 9.0.8, HTML Injection in Knowledge Base (KB) articles leads to complete page defacement imitating the login page. Authenticated users with the read knowledge article privilege can browse to the KB article and if they submit their credentials, they get captured in plain text. The vulnerability is allowed by **overly permissive HTML editing being allowed on the KB articles**. Any authenticated user with the privilege to read KB articles is impacted. In an enterprise with multiple applications, the malicious KB article could be edited to match the login pages of other applications, which would make it useful for credential harvesting against other applications as well. Version 9.0.8 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content based on the guidelines:

**Content from github.com_257d159b_20250624_184155.html**

*   **Relates to CVE?** Yes.
*   **Vulnerability Information:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Overly permissive HTML editing is allowed on Knowledge Base (KB) articles.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML Injection. The specific CWE is CWE-74.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Complete page defacement, imitating a login page, leading to the capture of user credentials in plain text (account takeover).
    *   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the privilege to create KB articles creates an article with a malicious HTML payload.  Authenticated users with read KB article privileges browse to the article and submit their credentials on the crafted login page.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have the privilege to create articles and knowledge of HTML.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:**  The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.0.8
    *   **More detail than official CVE description:** Yes, this provides a Proof of Concept (PoC).

**Content from github.com_aa0ec2f3_20250624_184153.html**

*   **Relates to CVE?** Yes.
*   **Vulnerability Information:**
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** This content details a commit that improves HTML sanitization.  Specifically, it removes the 'action' attribute from `<form>` elements, changes the `type` attribute of `<button>` elements with type "submit" to "button", and restricts certain CSS `style` properties, particularly `position: absolute|fixed|sticky`.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
