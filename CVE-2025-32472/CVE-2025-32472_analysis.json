CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400. The relationship indicates that CWE-770 is a more specific type of resource consumption issue. The attack described, Slowloris, involves exhausting resources, suggesting CWE-400 is applicable. While CWE-770 could provide more granularity, the description focuses on the consumption aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), specifically triggered by a Slowloris attack, where the attacker **allocates resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] as the primary weakness due to the DoS caused by a Slowloris attack. The evidence supports this because the **root cause** is a DoS vulnerability. The description states that \"The multiScan and picoScan are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack... by conducting a Slowloris-type attack, causing the web page to become unresponsive.\"\n\nCWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] was considered as a more specific alternative, since Slowloris attacks work by opening multiple connections without ever closing them, thus exhausting server resources.\n\nHowever, the description highlights the **unresponsiveness** which is a symptom of resource exhaustion, supporting CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption]. Although CWE-400 is discouraged, the evidence is more aligned to the consumption aspect, even if the allocation occurs without limits or throttling.\n\nThe decision is based on the available evidence and relationship analysis. The evidence is limited, leading to a slightly lower confidence score. Selecting CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is at the optimal level of specificity, adequately capturing the root cause given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Selected:* Not relevant because the vulnerability is not about exposing resources to the wrong sphere, but about exhausting resources.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* Not relevant because the vulnerability isn't directly related to the handling of exceptions, but to resource exhaustion.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n*Selected as Primary:* The vulnerability leads to denial of service by exhausting resources, which aligns well with the description of CWE-400.

This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not about memory buffer issues, but about resource exhaustion at a higher level.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
