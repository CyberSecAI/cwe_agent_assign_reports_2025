This is due to missing nonce validation in the afi_overview function and missing file type validation in the upload_icons function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.', key_phrases={'rootcause': [\"['missing nonce validation'\", \"'missing file type validation']\"], 'weakness': ['Arbitrary

Icons) plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 1.3', 'component': [\"['afi_overview function'\", \"'upload_icons function']\"]}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6309\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from two weaknesses:\\n    - Missing nonce validation in the `afi_overview` function.\\n    - Missing file type validation in the `upload_icons` function.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Due to the absence of nonce validation, an attacker can forge a request to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.\\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The lack of file type validation in the `upload_icons` function allows an attacker to upload files of any type to the server.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files.\\n- **Remote Code Execution:** If the uploaded file is an executable type (like PHP), it could lead to remote code execution on the server.\\n- **Full compromise of the server**\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The primary attack vector is a forged HTTP request crafted by the attacker.\\n- The attack requires tricking an authenticated WordPress administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request.\\n- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.\\n- The attacker must trick an authenticated WordPress administrator to perform an action.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n- The affected plugin is \"Attachment File Icons (AF Icons)\" for WordPress.\\n- The vulnerable versions are up to and including 1.3.\\n- There is no known patch available at the time of writing.\\n- The Wordfence article recommends uninstalling the plugin as a potential mitigation.',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Attachment File Icons (AF Icons) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** to **Arbitrary File Upload** in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing nonce validation in the afi_overview function and missing file type validation in the upload_icons function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: '['missing nonce validation''\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
