The impact of this is the potential for an attacker to replay a session and access patient records. While the description doesn't explicitly state that sensitive data is transmitted without encryption, it can be inferred, therefore it leads to **missing encryption of sensitive data** (CWE-311) and **insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522). The exploitation results in compromise of confidentiality of patient records.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the use of a **fixed AES-128 encryption key**. This aligns directly with CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).
