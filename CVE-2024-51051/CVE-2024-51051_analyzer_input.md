- **component:** Administrator account

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of two factors in AVSCMS 8.2.0:

1.  **Weak Default Credentials:** The application ships with a default administrative username and password of "admin:admin".
2.  **Lack of Password Policy/Management:** There is no enforced password strength policy, nor any interface for setting up password strength within the administrative panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The default "admin:admin" combination is a significant security flaw as it's widely known, making the application vulnerable out-of-the-box.
*   **Insufficient Password Complexity Enforcement:** The lack of password strength requirements allows users to set weak passwords, increasing the risk of successful attacks.
*   **Absence of Password Strength Management:** No controls are provided for administrators to enforce or manage password strength for all users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can easily gain administrative access by using the default credentials or user access using easily guessed passwords.
*   **Compromise of Application:** Successful access can lead to data breaches, manipulation, or complete takeover of the AVSCMS application, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the server it's on.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Login:** Attackers can directly log in using the default credentials if they are not changed by the administrator.
*   **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers can easily try common username/password combinations due to the lack of password complexity requirements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the AVSCMS installation to attempt logins.
*   **No Prior Knowledge (for Default Credentials):** If the default credentials haven't been changed, no prior knowledge beyond the application version is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes screenshots showing the default credentials, login with a weak user password, and the absence of password strength management, supporting the description of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities are also associated with specific CWE entries:
    *   CWE-1391:  Password complexity requirements for new passwords are not enforced.
    *  CWE-1392:  Password complexity requirements are not enforced for existing passwords.
    *   CWE-521:  Weak Password Requirements
*   The provided content also includes links to the relevant part of the source code on GitHub showing the default credential
