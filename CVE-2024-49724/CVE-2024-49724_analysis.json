Several potential child CWEs exist for CWE-362, such as CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) and CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread).

The relationship is that the **race condition** allows for an incorrect authorization to occur.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -- Leads To --> cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) in AccountManagerService.java, which allows bypassing permissions and launching protected activities, leading to a local escalation of privilege.\n  - The **race condition** (CWE-362) is the root cause.\n  - The impact is bypassing permissions and launching protected activities (CWE-863).\n  - This results in a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is a **race condition** (CWE-362) in multiple functions of AccountManagerService.java. This **race condition** allows for bypassing permissions (CWE-863) and launching protected activities, ultimately leading to a local escalation of privilege.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **race condition**. The description also mentions bypassing permissions and launching protected activities. This aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), as the **race condition** enables the bypass of authorization checks.\n\nThe provided evidence supports the selection of CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **race condition** as the root cause. The selection of CWE-863 is based on the impact of the **race condition**, which allows for bypassing permissions and launching protected activities.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-362 being a Class-level CWE and CWE-863 being a Class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n* CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n* CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization",
