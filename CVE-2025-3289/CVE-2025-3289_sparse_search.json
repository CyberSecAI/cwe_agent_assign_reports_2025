  "query": "A local code execution vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation Arena due to a stack-based memory buffer overflow. The flaw is result of improper validation of user-supplied data. If exploited a threat actor can disclose information and execute arbitrary code on the system. To exploit the vulnerability a legitimate user must open a malicious DOE file.",
