# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53136

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm revert mm shmem fix **data-race in shmem_getattr()** Revert d949d1d14fa2 (mm shmem fix **data-race in shmem_getattr()**) as suggested by Chuck [1]. It is causing deadlocks when accessing tmpfs over NFS. As Hugh commented, added just to silence a syzbot sanitizer splat added where there has never been any practical problem.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **data-race in shmem_getattr()**
- **impact:** deadlocks
- **product:** Linux kernel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a problematic fix (commit `d949d1d14fa2`) that attempted to address a data race in the `shmem_getattr()` function within the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem. This fix introduced a shared lock, which led to deadlocks when accessing tmpfs (a temporary file storage) over NFS (Network File System).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The initial vulnerability was a **data race** in `shmem_getattr()`.
- The fix introduced a **deadlock** when accessing tmpfs over NFS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The data race itself was reportedly not causing any practical issues, as stated by Hugh Dickins: "added just to silence a syzbot sanitizer splat: added where there has never been any practical problem".
- The incorrect fix caused severe issues like **deadlocks** when accessing tmpfs over NFS. These deadlocks would render the system unusable and require a reboot to resolve.

**Attack vectors:**
- The original data race was likely triggered by concurrent access to shared memory metadata.
- The deadlock can be triggered by attempting to access tmpfs over NFS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the original data race, no specific attacker capabilities were mentioned, as it was a concurrency issue within the kernel.
- For the deadlock, the attacker would need to be in a position to access tmpfs over NFS. This could be a user on a system sharing tmpfs via NFS or a process that uses tmpfs and also interacts with NFS.

**Technical Details:**
The provided diffs show the removal of `inode_lock_shared(inode)` and `inode_unlock_shared(inode)` calls from the `shmem_getattr()` function in `mm/shmem.c`. This removal represents the revert of the problematic fix that introduced the deadlock. The commits are all reverts of the same original commit (d949d1d14fa2).
