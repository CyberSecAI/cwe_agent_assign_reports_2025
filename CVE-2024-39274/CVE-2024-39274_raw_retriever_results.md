# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39274
## Query
Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.0, 9.5.x <= 9.5.6, 9.7.x <= 9.7.5 and 9.8.x <= 9.8.1 fail to properly validate that the channel that comes from the sync message is a shared channel, when shared channels are enabled, which allows a malicious remote to add users to arbitrary teams and channels

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'fail to properly validate that the channel is a shared channel'
