  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Aishida Call Center System up to 20250314. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /doscall/weixin/open/amr2mp3. The manipulation of the argument File leads to **command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

It is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-78 is a more specific case of command injection, focusing on OS commands.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `File` argument. This leads to OS **command injection**, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `File` argument leads to **command injection**. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). Given that the injection allows for execution of OS commands, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice.
