  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37887:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in how Nextcloud handles recurrence exceptions in shared calendar events. Specifically, when a user shares a calendar, the system does not properly restrict access to recurrence exceptions associated with private events.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Private event details, specifically recurrence exceptions, are being exposed to users who have been granted access to the calendar. This violates the intended privacy of the events.\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to enforce proper access control regarding recurrence exceptions for shared calendars.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to private calendar event details, specifically the recurrence exceptions. This could expose sensitive information related to the timing or modifications of private events.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network access via the web interface or CalDAV.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must have been granted access to a shared calendar that contains private events with recurrence exceptions.\n- The attacker needs to be a valid Nextcloud user with access to the shared calendar.\n- The attacker needs to view the shared calendar through the web interface or a CalDAV client.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"Low\" severity.\n- The vulnerability was reported by \"section1\".\n- Patches are available in Nextcloud versions 27.1.10, 28.0.6, and 29.0.1.\n- The related pull request that fixes the issue is https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/45309.\n- The issue affects both Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server.\n- The vulnerability is tracked by GHSA-h4xv-cjpm-j595.\n- There is no known workaround.\n- CVSS v3 base metrics are AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n\nThe provided information is consistent with the CVE description, and provides additional details regarding the vulnerability.",

There is no direct hierarchical relationship between them in the CWE structure, but they can be considered related in the context of this vulnerability. CWE-201 directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information** into sent data (the shared calendar events), while CWE-639 relates to the **authorization bypass** aspect, where sharees are able to access recurrence exceptions that they should not be authorized to view.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **inadequate access control**, leading to **information disclosure**.\n\n1.  **Inadequate Access Control:** The system **does not properly restrict access** to recurrence exceptions in shared calendar events.\n2.  **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201):** As a result of the **inadequate access control**, private event details (recurrence exceptions) are exposed to unauthorized users (sharees).\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-201, reflecting the direct consequence of the **weakness**, which is the **insertion of sensitive information** into data sent to unauthorized parties.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly states that \"Private shared calendar events recurrence exceptions can be read by sharees\" and that \"the system does not properly restrict access to recurrence exceptions associated with private events\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves the **insertion of sensitive information** (private calendar event recurrence exceptions) into data that is sent to other actors (sharees) who should not have access to that information. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-201.\n\nCWE-639 is included as a secondary CWE because the underlying problem is an **authorization bypass** where sharees are able to access data that they should not be authorized to view. The system's authorization **fails to prevent unauthorized access** to recurrence exceptions.\n\nBoth CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF
