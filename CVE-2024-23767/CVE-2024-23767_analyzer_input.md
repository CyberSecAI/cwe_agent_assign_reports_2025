## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23767:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the HICP (HMS Industrial Configuration Protocol) itself, a proprietary protocol used by HMS Networks for IP network configuration of their devices. The protocol lacks proper security measures, such as encryption and strong authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Lack of Authentication (Default):** Authentication is disabled by default in the HICP protocol. This allows unauthenticated users to change network settings by sending valid requests.
2.  **Clear-text Password Transmission:** When authentication is enabled, the password is sent in clear text with every request, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
3.  **Weak Password Policy:** The protocol doesn't enforce password policies, allowing weak passwords like 'a' to be set.
4.  **Brute-force Vulnerability:** The service is vulnerable to brute-force attacks to discover the password.
5.  **Authentication Bypass:** Even with authentication enabled via HICP, the web interface allows changing network settings without any authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can:
1. **Change network settings:** This could render the device unreachable or redirect traffic, disrupting industrial operations.
2. **Denial of Service:** By changing network configuration settings, the attacker can cause a denial of service by making the device unreachable.
3.  **Set an attacker-controlled password:** Prevent legitimate users from changing settings back by enabling authentication with an attacker-defined password.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the device, either from the OT network, IT network, or the internet. The HICP protocol operates over UDP port 3250.
2. **HICP Protocol Exploitation:** The attacker uses HICP requests to exploit the weaknesses of the protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the target device on port 3250.
2. **HICP Protocol Knowledge:** Some understanding of HICP protocol is necessary but is straightforward as the protocol is text-based.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The blog post highlights that the HICP protocol itself is fundamentally flawed and requires a complete redesign, which HMS Networks has addressed with a new, secure SHICP protocol. However, the tested device does not support SHICP.
* The blog provides a link to a python script implementing HICP, highlighting the ease of exploitation: [https://github.com/claire-lex/anybus-hicp/blob/main/hicp_config.py](https://github.com/claire-lex/anybus-hicp/blob/main/hicp_config.py)
*   The vendor's response was to not patch older devices but offer a new model using a secure protocol, leaving older hardware vulnerable.
