  "description": "The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin Super Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.13.68. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68.",

  "reference_content": "### Summary:\nThe provided content describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin \u2013 Super Socializer plugin for WordPress, affecting versions up to and including 7.13.68.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability arises from insufficient verification of user information returned by social login tokens.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The plugin fails to properly validate the user identity during social login, allowing unauthorized access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can log in as any existing user on the WordPress site by exploiting the flawed social login mechanism.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** This vulnerability enables attackers to gain access to user accounts without proper credentials.\n*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not an inherent aspect of this vulnerability, if administrator accounts have social login explicitly enabled, they are also vulnerable to this attack, potentially leading to complete site compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Social Login:** The vulnerability is exploited through the social login functionality of the plugin.\n*   **Network:** The attacker can be remote (i.e. the attack vector is network based).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.\n*   **Email Access:** The attacker needs access to the email of the target user, but the user needs to have no existing account using social login with the service used by the attacker.\n*   **Social Login:** The attacker must leverage a social login service supported by the plugin.\n*   **Network Access:** Attacker requires network access to send requests.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68. A full fix is provided in version 7.14, and subsequent updates.\n*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.1 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n*   The plugin now checks if Vkontakte account is verified before saving the email and Spotify account email is no longer fetched.\n*   The issue has been fixed in versions 7.13.68 and 7.14",

The vulnerability stems from **insufficient verification** during the authentication process using social login tokens. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed. Could be considered since an attacker can bypass authentication, but **improper authentication** is more accurate as the function intends to authenticate but does so incorrectly. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review. While authentication is bypassed, authorization is not the primary issue. The problem lies in the **insufficient verification** of the user's identity during authentication, which then leads to **incorrect authorization** downstream. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-287, which falls under the broader category of authentication issues. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered, CWE-287 more accurately reflects the root cause because authentication mechanisms are present but **improperly** implemented. The relationships between these CWEs are hierarchical, with CWE-287 being a child of a more general authentication weakness. The choice of CWE-287 is further justified because it's more specific than the parent classes and aligns with the details provided in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe287 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient verification** of the user being returned by the social login token (CWE-287), leading to the ability for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site. If administrator accounts have explicitly been allowed via the social login, privilege escalation may be possible.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points towards **improper authentication** as the root cause. The description states: \"This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**.\" This directly indicates a failure in the authentication process, specifically, the verification of the user's identity via the social login token.\n\nThe Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications further support this assessment. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) was considered, it was deemed less accurate because the authentication process is present, albeit flawed. The mapping guidance distinguishing between authentication and authorization also helped refine the selection.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is based on its specificity and alignment with the root cause described in the vulnerability. It represents the **insufficient verification** of the user identity during social login, which leads to the **authentication bypass**. This decision is supported by the evidence from the vulnerability description and reinforced by the relationships between relevant CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- Vulnerability Description:
