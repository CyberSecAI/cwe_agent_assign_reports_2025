  "description": "BerriAI/litellm version 1.40.12 contains a vulnerability that allows remote code execution. The issue exists in the handling of the post_call_rules configuration, where a **callback function** can be added. The provided value is split at the final . mark, with the last part considered the function name and the remaining part appended with the .py extension and imported. This allows an attacker to set a system method, such as os.system, as a callback, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands when a chat response is processed.",

The evidence points toward code injection due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands, making CWE-94 the more specific and fitting choice as the primary CWE. CWE-78 is added as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability allows for os commands to be run.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe78 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the post_call_rules configuration**, leading to the **ability to set a system method as a callback**, which then allows for **arbitrary command execution** and **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered multiple CWEs related to injection and neutralization, but the ability to execute arbitrary code pointed strongly towards CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')). The vulnerability description states that \"This allows an attacker to set a system method, such as os.system, as a callback, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands when a chat response is processed.\" This clearly indicates that the system is generating and executing code based on external input.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is further justified by the ability to set `os.system` as a callback, which directly leads to OS command execution, leading to the selection of CWE-78.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause (code injection) and a specific consequence (OS command injection).
