  "description": "A CWE-598 Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings was discovered affecting the 130.8005 TCP/IP Gateway running firmware version 12h. Both the SHA-1 hash of the password as well as the session tokens are included as part of the URL and therefore exposed to information leakage scenarios. An attacker capable of accessing such values (e.g., victim browser, network traffic inspection) can exploit this vulnerability to leak both the password hash as well as session tokens and bypass the authentication mechanism using a pass-the-hash attack.",

CWE-201 can lead to other issues such as CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer). CWE-598 is also related to CWE-319, as transmitting sensitive information in query strings often leads to cleartext transmission. The relationships guide the selection towards the most specific CWE, which is CWE-598, while also considering the broader context of information leakage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe598 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe319\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings (CWE-598)**, leading to the inclusion of sensitive information (password hash, session tokens) in the URL. This results in the **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)** and **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)**, which ultimately allows an attacker to leak password hashes and session tokens, bypassing authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-598 Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings** as the primary **rootcause**. The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link, which clearly states that the **rootcause** is the **Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings (CWE-598)**. This choice is further supported by the Retriever Results, where CWE-598 is listed as a top combined result. The graph relationships show that CWE-598 is a specific variant of CWE-201, making it the optimal choice for specificity. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of GET requests with sensitive data in the query string.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
