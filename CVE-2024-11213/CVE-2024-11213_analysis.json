  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Best Employee Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/edit_role.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11213 (Based on content mentioning \"Authenticated Time-Based SQL Injection in Employee management system\")\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is the improper handling of the `id` parameter in the `edit_role.php` script. This parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in a POST request. Specifically, the attacker can use the `SLEEP()` function to introduce time delays and confirm successful SQL injection based on the response time.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Time-based SQL injection can cause significant delays and potentially lead to a denial of service by using functions like `SLEEP()`.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** If exploited further, it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of critical data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in a POST request to the `edit_role.php` script.\n- The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable `edit_role.php` script.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using a `SLEEP()` function within the injected SQL.\n- The content also mentions that tools like `sqlmap`/`ghauri` can be used for automated exploitation.\n- Mitigation steps include using prepared statements, parameterized queries, ORM libraries, input validation and SQL query timeouts.",

The application fails to neutralize special elements in SQL commands, leading to SQL Injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability to **CWE-89**, with the description clearly indicating a failure to neutralize special elements used in SQL commands, leading to SQL injection. No other hierarchical or chain relationships strongly influenced the decision, as the provided information focuses on the **SQL Injection** vulnerability itself. The abstraction level of Base was appropriate as it directly represents the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Neutralization** of input, specifically the `id` parameter, leading directly to the impact of **SQL Injection**.\n\nImproper Input Handling -> SQL Injection\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary, all of which point to **SQL Injection** as the primary vulnerability. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" clearly state \"**weakness: sql injection**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states the root cause as \"improper handling of the `id` parameter\" and that \"This parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.\". The mitigation information also supports this, as using prepared statements and parameterized queries are common defenses against **SQL Injection**.\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the decision, as the primary factor was the direct match of the vulnerability to the **CWE-89** description. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**:

CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product

particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1255.34\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1099.65\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-89:**\n- 89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-80:**\n- 80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
