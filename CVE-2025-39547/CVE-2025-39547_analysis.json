The impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nNot specified in detail, but relies on exploiting CSRF.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nUpdate to version 5.1.4 or later. Patchstack users can enable auto-update for vulnerable plugins.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   CVSS score: 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   Reported by: johska\n*   Published by Patchstack: 16 April 2025\n*   OWASP Top 10: A3: Injection\n*   PSID: ef59ce68d37c\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.",
