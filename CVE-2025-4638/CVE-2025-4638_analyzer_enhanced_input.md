## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability exists in the inftrees.c component of the zlib library, which is bundled within the PointCloudLibrary (PCL). This issue may allow context-dependent attackers to cause undefined behavior by exploiting **improper pointer arithmetic**. Since version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper pointer arithmetic**
- **impact:** undefined behavior
- **attacker:** context-dependent attackers
- **product:** PointCloudLibrary (PCL)
- **version:** before 1.14.0
- **component:** inftrees.c component of the zlib library

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2016-9840 is addressed in the provided content. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from subtracting an offset from a pointer to an array in `inftrees.c`. This is not compliant with the C standard, leading to undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Potential for undefined behavior due to pointer arithmetic.
*   Vulnerability in the `inflate_table()` function, cloned from zlib, that did not receive a security patch.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The content doesn't explicitly detail the impact, but it implies a security risk due to undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

Not explicitly stated, but related to the processing of compressed data using the vulnerable `inflate_table()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

Not specified.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The fix involves applying a patch (originally from madler/zlib@6a04314) to remove the problematic offset pointer optimization in `inftrees.c`.  The fix was merged in commit `b5234de`.

Additionally, the content notes that PCL versions 1.14.0 and later use a system zlib installation by default (unless explicitly disabled), mitigating the vulnerability for those versions.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It explains the root cause, the specific file and function involved, the origin of the patch, and the mitigation strategy. It also clarifies the version dependency for the fix.
