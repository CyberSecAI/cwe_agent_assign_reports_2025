CWE-122 is a variant of the more general CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer].

The key phrase \"out-of-bounds read\" directly maps to CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read].

The retriever results also list it as the top candidate. The evidence supports a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122 [CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow]) as a contributing factor, so it is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nCWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] was considered, but the vulnerability is specifically described as an out-of-bounds read, not a write.
