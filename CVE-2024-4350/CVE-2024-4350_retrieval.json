A rogue administrator could inject malicious code into fields due to **insufficient input validation**. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.0 with a vector of AVN/ACH/PRH/UIN/SC/CL/IN/AN https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator and a CVSS v4 score of 2.1 with vector CVSS4.0/AVN/ACH/ATN/PRH/UIN/VCL/VIN/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN https//www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS4.0/AVN/ACH/ATN/PRH/UIN/VCL/VIN/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN Thanks, m3dium for reporting.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'insufficient input validation', 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'inject malicious code', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'rogue administrator', 'product': 'Concrete CMS', 'version': '9.0.0 to 9.3.2 below 8.5.18', 'component': 'RSS Displayer'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4350:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient input validation in the RSS Displayer block. This lack of validation allowed a malicious administrator to inject arbitrary code into the system.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious code injected through the RSS Displayer block is stored on the server and executed when other users interact with the affected content.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of a user viewing the affected page.\\n- This could lead to malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- Network Access: The attacker can inject malicious code through the RSS Displayer block, which would typically be accessed via a web browser.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to modify the content of the RSS Displayer block.\\n- The attacker would need to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit content.\\n\\n**Additional Details from the provided content:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability exists specifically in the `rss_displayer` block within the Concrete CMS.\\n*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed by implementing input sanitization in the RSS Displayer block.\\n*   **Versions Affected:**  The vulnerability affected Concrete CMS versions 8 and 9. The fix was implemented with commit `c08d9671cec4e7afdabb547339c4bc0bed8eab06` for version 8 and commit `12166` for version 9.\\n*   **CVSS Score:** The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.0 with a vector of `AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N` and a CVSS v4 score of 2.1 with vector `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`\\n\\nThis information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and its resolution.\",
