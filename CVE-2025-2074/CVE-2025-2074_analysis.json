  "description": "The Advanced Google reCAPTCHA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the sSearch parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.29 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries, particularly when the plugins settings page hasnt been visited and its welcome message has not been dismissed. This issue can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

This aligns with the description of CWE-89, where a lack of proper input validation allows attackers to modify the intended SQL command.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads to the ability to inject SQL commands, ultimately resulting in the extraction of sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states the root cause as **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, resulting in SQL injection. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is optimal because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the failure to properly neutralize special elements in SQL commands. The evidence clearly supports this classification, and the CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base).\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected*: CSRF is not the **root cause** of this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
