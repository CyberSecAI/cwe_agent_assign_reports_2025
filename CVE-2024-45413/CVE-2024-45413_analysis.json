The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the `rsa_decrypt` function.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `rsa_decrypt` function not checking the length of the decrypted data before storing it on the stack. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) if the decrypted data exceeds the allocated buffer size, ultimately resulting in remote code execution (RCE) as root.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on explicit information from the vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary, which states, \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" vulnerability in rsa_decrypt function. This function is an API wrapper for LUA to decrypt RSA encrypted ciphertext, the decrypted data is stored on the stack without checking its length.
