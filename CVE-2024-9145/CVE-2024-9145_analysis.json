  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a local command injection flaw within the Wiz Visual Studio Code Extension. This flaw is triggered when the extension processes a maliciously crafted Docker image file. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the extension attempts to pull a base image before scanning the dockerfile if the pull feature isn't disabled and an attacker can control the docker image name.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. This means that the extension, when handling a malicious Docker image file, executes user-controlled input as a system command.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The extension fails to properly sanitize or validate the input related to the docker image name before passing it to a command execution context.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Local Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's workstation. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:\n    *   Data exfiltration (stealing source code, secrets, credentials)\n    *   Malware installation\n    *   System compromise\n    *   Lateral movement to other systems within the network.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Maliciously Crafted Docker Image File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Docker image file. This file must contain malicious input that, when processed by the vulnerable extension, leads to command injection.\n*   **Trusted Folder Requirement:** The victim needs to open the malicious Docker image file from a folder marked as \"trusted\" within Visual Studio Code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Ability to create a malicious Docker image file:** The attacker needs to craft a Dockerfile with the malicious command to be injected\n*   **Social engineering/malware distribution:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file with the vulnerable extension.\n*  **Trusted Folder:**  The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious dockerfile from a folder marked as trusted in VS Code.",

The chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), specifically related to the Docker image name.\n2.  Due to the **lack of input sanitization**, special elements in the Docker image name are not properly neutralized.\n3.

The extension fails to properly sanitize the docker image name, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands. The primary CWE is CWE-78, as the vulnerability stems from the application's failure to neutralize special elements in an OS command. The description states the extension is vulnerable to local **command injection** if a user opens a maliciously crafted Dockerfile. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** is due to the extension's failure to sanitize input related to the docker image name before passing it to a command execution context. \"The vulnerability stems from a local command injection flaw...This flaw is triggered when the extension processes a maliciously crafted Docker image file...the extension fails to properly sanitize or validate the input related to the docker image name before passing it to a command execution context.\"\n\nCWE-77 was considered but not chosen as it is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-78 is a more specific Base-level CWE. CWE-20 was considered as a contributing factor due to the **lack of input validation**, but it is a Class-level CWE and is only tangentially related to the **command injection**. The primary cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements, which is best represented by CWE-78. Other CWEs such as CWE-121, CWE-119, CWE-427, CWE-1336, and CWE-138 were also considered, but they are not directly related to the **command injection** vulnerability.",
