Though normally discouraged, there isn't enough information provided to select a more specific base or variant CWE. It's clear **incorrect access control** led to viewing sensitive information, but the exact mechanism isn't specified. Therefore, it is the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe522 -->|PeerOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control**, which leads to the exposure of usernames and passwords. This is a direct impact, and the chain is relatively short.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states **incorrect access control** as the root cause, leading to sensitive information exposure. The retriever results also suggest CWE-284, along with other related CWEs like CWE-522.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-284 is due to its high-level nature, fitting the description where the exact mechanism of **incorrect access control** is not detailed. Had there been more information, a more specific CWE (like CWE-863 or CWE-306) would have been considered. CWE-522 is a secondary consideration due to the sensitive information being usernames and passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
