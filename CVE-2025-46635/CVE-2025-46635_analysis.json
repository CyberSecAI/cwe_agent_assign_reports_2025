While less specific, it broadly covers the **improper network isolation**. The secondary CWE, CWE-425, represents the \"Forced Browsing\" aspect, where an attacker gains unauthorized access by directly requesting resources. CWE-284 is a parent of more specific access control issues, while CWE-425 is a base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper network isolation** (CWE-284), allowing an attacker to configure a static IP address and then access resources on the router and other networks (CWE-425).\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n  - **Weakness:** Improper Network Isolation\n  - **Impact:** CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper network isolation**, leading to the selection of CWE-284. The ability to configure a static IP and access resources was considered as a form of \"Forced Browsing\" (CWE-425). The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper network isolation between the guest Wi-Fi network and other network interfaces** on the router allows an attacker (who is authenticated to the guest Wi-Fi) to access resources on the router and/or resources and devices on other networks hosted by the router by configuring a static IP address (within the non-guest subnet) on their host.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-425 is a child of CWE-284, indicating a more specific type of access control issue. While CWE-284 is a Pillar, it captures the essence of the **improper isolation** root cause. CWE-425 is included as a secondary CWE to capture the specific attack vector.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an adequate level of specificity, considering the information provided. A more detailed analysis of the access control mechanisms would be necessary to identify a more specific child of CWE-284.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
