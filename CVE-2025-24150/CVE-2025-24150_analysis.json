CVE-2025-24150 is specifically mentioned in all three documents.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Safari 18.3 & macOS Sequoia 15.3:** Copying a URL from Web Inspector may lead to command injection. A privacy issue was addressed with improved handling of files.\n*   **iOS 18.3/iPadOS 18.3:** Copying a URL from Web Inspector may lead to command injection. A privacy issue was addressed with improved handling of files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Command injection vulnerability in WebKit Web Inspector.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands by exploiting the command injection vulnerability when copying a URL from Web Inspector.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL and tricking a user into copying it from Web Inspector.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL copied from Web Inspector.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Improved handling of files within WebKit Web Inspector.\n*   The issue was addressed with improved handling of files.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Researcher:** Johan Carlsson (joaxcar)\n*   **WebKit Bugzilla:** 283718\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically mentioning the researcher and the WebKit Bugzilla ID.",

This is the root cause of the vulnerability because copying a URL from Web Inspector may lead to command injection. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The root cause of command injection can be traced back to **Improper Input Validation**, as the application **fails to properly neutralize special elements**. However, this is too general. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a Base level weakness. It is related to CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, because command injection often stems from a failure to validate or sanitize input properly. CWE-78 is more specific than CWE-20, making it a better fit for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ['OS Command Injection']\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Handling of files** when copying a URL from Web Inspector which leads to the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements**, resulting in **Command Injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates that copying a URL from Web Inspector may lead to command injection. The root cause is identified as **improper handling of files**, resulting in command injection. CWE-78 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the vulnerability of command injection due to **improper neutralization of special elements**.\n\nThe selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly describes the root cause, whereas other CWEs are either too general (e.g., CWE-20) or address related but not central aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) as top candidates. However, these were not selected as the primary CWE because the description points to a command injection vulnerability, which is most accurately represented by CWE-78. While **Improper Input Validation** could be a contributing factor, it is too general and doesn't capture the specific type of injection.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ['OS Command Injection']\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n\n**Description**: The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
