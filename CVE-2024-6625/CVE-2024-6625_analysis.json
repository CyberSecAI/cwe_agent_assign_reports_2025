  "description": "The WP Total Branding - Complete branding solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6625:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP Total Branding WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `login-header-title` setting, which allows users to customize the login page header, is not properly sanitized when saved and not properly escaped when displayed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input for the login header title, and then displays this unsanitized input on the login page. This lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the 'login-header-title' input when it is saved into the database.\n- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the stored 'login-header-title' when it is rendered on the page.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the login page.\n- The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the login page.\n- This can lead to various malicious activities including:\n    - Session hijacking\n    - Redirecting users to malicious websites\n    - Defacement of the login page\n    - Performing administrative actions on the WordPress site on behalf of a logged-in administrator.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker with administrative privileges or above can access the plugin's settings.\n- They can then input malicious JavaScript code into the 'login-header-title' field.\n- The malicious script is stored in the database, and rendered on the login page.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level permissions or above on the target WordPress site.\n- The attacker needs to be able to access the WP Total Branding settings page within the WordPress admin panel.\n- The vulnerability is only present in multisite installations or installations where the `unfiltered_html` capability has been disabled.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3 of the plugin.\n- The fix involved adding `sanitize_text_field` to sanitize the input and `esc_html` to escape the output.\n- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Artem Polynko.",
