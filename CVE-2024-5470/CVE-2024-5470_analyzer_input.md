# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5470

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 17.0 prior to 17.0.4 and from 17.1 prior to 17.1.2 where a Guest user with `admin_push_rules` permission may have been able to create project-level deploy tokens.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** create project-level deploy tokens
- **attacker:** Guest user with admin_push_rules permission
- **product:** GitLab CE/EE
- **version:** all versions starting from 17.0 prior to 17.0.4 and from 17.1 prior to 17.1.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user with the custom role permission "Manage push rules" is able to create project-level deploy tokens, which should only be accessible by owners of the Group/Project. This occurs due to the permission associated with "Manage push rules" being overly permissive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Authorization Bypass:** The "Manage push rules" permission allows unintended creation of deploy tokens.
    - **Inadequate Access Control:** Custom roles are not properly restricting access to deploy token creation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized read/write access to project-level packages, repositories, and registry images.
    - Potential data exfiltration, tampering, and supply chain compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  The attacker needs a user account with the "Manage push rules" permission within the target group.
    - The attacker crafts a POST request to create a deploy token, mimicking the legitimate request, using their own credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must have a user account with the custom role that includes "Manage push rules" permission within the target group.
    - Attacker can be a guest with this permission.
    - Attacker must also know the project ID to perform the attack, as the request contains the project-specific path.

**Additional details:**
- The report mentions that the issue was found on gitlab.com, and it might also affect Gitlab community/Enterprise edition.
- The report includes detailed steps to reproduce the issue, along with the specific HTTP request and response involved in exploiting the vulnerability.
- A CVSS score of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N is provided with Confidentiality and Integrity rated High.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
