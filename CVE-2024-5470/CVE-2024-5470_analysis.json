This occurs due to the permission associated with \"Manage push rules\" being overly permissive.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - **Authorization Bypass:** The \"Manage push rules\" permission allows unintended creation of deploy tokens.\n    - **Inadequate Access Control:** Custom roles are not properly restricting access to deploy token creation.\n- **Impact of exploitation:**\n    - Unauthorized read/write access to project-level packages, repositories, and registry images.\n    - Potential data exfiltration, tampering, and supply chain compromise.\n- **Attack vectors:**\n    -  The attacker needs a user account with the \"Manage push rules\" permission within the target group.\n    - The attacker crafts a POST request to create a deploy token, mimicking the legitimate request, using their own credentials.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    - Attacker must have a user account with the custom role that includes \"Manage push rules\" permission within the target group.\n    - Attacker can be a guest with this permission.\n    - Attacker must also know the project ID to perform the attack, as the request contains the project-specific path.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The report mentions that the issue was found on gitlab.com, and it might also affect Gitlab community/Enterprise edition.\n- The report includes detailed steps to reproduce the issue, along with the specific HTTP request and response involved in exploiting the vulnerability.\n- A CVSS score of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N is provided with Confidentiality and Integrity rated High.",

The `admin_push_rules` privilege allows actions that it should not. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The authorization check is present but doesn't work correctly because it allows the `admin_push_rules` permission to create deploy tokens. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-267, which describes a privilege that allows unintended and unsafe actions. CWE-863 is a secondary consideration, representing an incorrect authorization check that fails to prevent unauthorized actions. The relationship is that CWE-267 provides the overly permissive privilege, and CWE-863 represents the failure to properly authorize actions based on that privilege. The abstraction levels were considered, and CWE-267 at the Base level was chosen as a more specific root cause than the Class-level CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe267 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe267 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions)**, where the `admin_push_rules` privilege is overly permissive. This leads to an **Authorization Bypass**, as a Guest user with this privilege can create project-level deploy tokens. The ultimate impact is unauthorized read/write access to project-level packages, repositories, and registry images.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-267 as the primary weakness, based on the evidence that the `admin_push_rules` privilege allowed unintended actions. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states that \"This occurs due to the permission associated with 'Manage push rules' being overly permissive.\" The Retriever Results also listed CWE-267 as a candidate, further reinforcing this selection. The relationship graph highlights how the overly permissive privilege can lead to authorization bypass. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the description of the overly permissive nature of the `admin_push_rules` privilege. CWE-267 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
