# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-29926

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-29926

## Description

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to 15.10.15, 16.4.6, and 16.10.0, any user can exploit the WikiManager REST API to create a new wiki, where the user could become an administrator and so performs other attacks on the farm. Note that this REST API is not bundled in XWiki Standard by default it needs to be installed manually through the extension manager. The problem has been patched in versions 15.10.15, 16.4.6 and 16.10.0 of the REST module.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** become an administrator
- **Attacker:** any user
- **Product:** XWiki Platform
- **Version:** prior to 15.10.15, 16.4.6, and 16.10.0
- **Component:** WikiManager REST API

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-285, Improper Authorization, which is a Class-level CWE. While it's generally preferred to use Base-level CWEs, in this case, CWE-285 accurately reflects the **incorrect authorization** check performed by the WikiManager REST API. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a potential related issue, as the API lacks authentication which leads to the authorization bypass.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** within the WikiManager REST API (CWE-285). Because no authentication is required(CWE-306) any user can create a new wiki. The impact of this is that the attacker becomes an administrator of the newly created wiki.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provides strong evidence for the chosen CWEs.

The primary weakness is that the WikiManager REST API **did not properly check user permissions**, allowing any user to create new wikis. This directly aligns with CWE-285, Improper Authorization. The content summary states the impact of this is that an unauthenticated user can create a new wiki, and the user becomes an administrator of the newly created wiki, gaining access to restricted content.

The selection of CWE-285 is further justified by the fact that the root cause of the vulnerability is that the WikiManager REST API in XWiki **did not properly check user permissions**. This highlights an **incorrect authorization** mechanism.

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, was considered because the vulnerability description mentions that **no authentication is required**. While authentication is missing, the authorization is **incorrect** which is why CWE-285 is a better fit.

The evidence strongly supports the mapping of CWE-285 as the primary CWE, as it directly addresses the **improper authorization** issue that allows unauthorized users to create new wikis and gain administrative privileges.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
