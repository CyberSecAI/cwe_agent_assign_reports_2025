The content provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes root cause, impact, attack vectors, and mitigation steps.\\n\\n**CVE-2024-26290: Authenticated Remote Command Injection**\\n\\n*   **Root cause:** The Avid NEXIS Web Agent does not validate input IP addresses when executing system functions, allowing command injection.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Input validation failure, Remote Code Execution (RCE).\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute commands on the target machine with root/SYSTEM privileges.\\n*   **Attack vectors:**  A crafted `GET` request to `/agent?r=tools&type=ping&host=...` with a malicious payload in the `host` parameter.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\\n    *   Upgrade to NEXIS 2024.6.0 (available June 18, 2024).\\n    *   Configure a firewall rule to whitelist access to the Storage Manager Agent (Port 5015).\\n\\n**Other Vulnerabilities (Not directly related to CVE-2024-26290 but reported in the same advisory):**\\n\\n*   **CVE-2024-26291: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read:**  Lack of path validation allows reading arbitrary files.\\n*   **CVE-2024-26292: Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:** Allows authenticated users to delete arbitrary files.\\n*   **CVE-2024-26293: Unauthenticated Path Traversal:**  Vulnerability in gSOAP 2.8 allows reading arbitrary files.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The advisory details a lengthy disclosure timeline, with initial contact attempts to the vendor in July 2023 and a resolution for CVE-2024-26290 in August 2024.\\n*   The author recommends restricting access to the agent port (5015) as a general mitigation strategy.\\n*   The advisory mentions that the vendor did not issue CVEs for the other vulnerabilities.\\n*   The content indicates the vulnerabilities were found in Avid NEXIS Agent 22.12.0.174 and potentially earlier versions.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},
