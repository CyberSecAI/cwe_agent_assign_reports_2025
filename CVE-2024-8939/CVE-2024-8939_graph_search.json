The API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts a best_of parameter to return the best completion from several options. When this parameter is set to a large value, the API does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a DoS by consuming excessive system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-400 CWE-130 CWE-770 CWE-834 CWE-1427 CWE-193 CWE-789 CWE-943 CWE-1333",
