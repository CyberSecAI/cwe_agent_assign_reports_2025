# Analysis for CVE-2024-12511

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, indicating a missing authentication issue. CWE-306 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of detail. CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE, which is higher level of abstraction, and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. CWE-306 is a parent of CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication) and CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel). CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related to authorization bypass.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306). This allows unauthorized modification of SMB/FTP settings, leading to redirection of scans and potential capture of credentials, which are then **insufficiently protected** (CWE-522).

## Summary of Analysis
Based on the vulnerability description, the primary issue is the **missing authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306), which enables the modification of SMB/FTP settings and the potential capture of credentials. These credentials, once captured, are likely **insufficiently protected** (CWE-522).

The retriever results suggest several potential CWEs, including CWE-923, CWE-522, and CWE-306. CWE-306 is chosen as the primary CWE because the root cause is the **missing authentication**. CWE-522 is considered as a secondary weakness because captured credentials are not adequately protected.

The confidence is relatively high because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that SMB/FTP settings could be modified and credentials captured, which directly relates to **missing authentication** and **insufficient protection** of those credentials.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.
