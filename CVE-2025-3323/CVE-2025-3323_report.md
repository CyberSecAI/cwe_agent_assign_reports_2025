The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.

Relevant evidence from the vulnerability description:
- "**weakness:** **sql injection**"
- "The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **sql injection**."

The other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant:
- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - While input neutralization is relevant, the specific vulnerability is SQL injection, not XSS.
- CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This is not related to file uploads.
- CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine - Not related to template engines.
- CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs - Not related to log injection.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the SQL Injection vulnerability described.
