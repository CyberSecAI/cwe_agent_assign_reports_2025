While other CWEs like CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) and CWE-415 (Double Free) were considered, the evidence points more directly to a memory corruption issue due to concurrent access potentially leading to out-of-bounds writes. The abstraction level of Base for both CWE-787 and CWE-366 is appropriate, representing specific coding errors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    \n    cwe366 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe366 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-366) arising from concurrent access to the same trusted application by an invoke call and a TEE call. This **race condition** can lead to **memory corruption** specifically through an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The evidence is limited and further steps in the chain are not clear.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the **memory corruption**. The evidence provided is limited to the observation that the corruption occurs when an invoke call and a TEE call are bound for the same trusted application. This suggests a potential concurrency issue. The retriever results pointed towards CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the top candidate. Given the limited information, I am assigning CWE-787 as the primary CWE and CWE-366 as a secondary CWE due to the potential **race condition**. This assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence and the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
