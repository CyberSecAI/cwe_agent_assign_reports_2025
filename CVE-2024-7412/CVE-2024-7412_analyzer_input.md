# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7412

## Vulnerability Description
The No Update Nag plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.12. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7412

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `No Update Nag` plugin allowing direct access to the `bootstrap.php` file, which has `display_errors` turned on. This setting, intended for debugging, causes the application to reveal its full file path when accessed directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The primary weakness is the exposure of the web application's full file path.
- **Direct Access to `bootstrap.php`:** The plugin doesn't restrict access to the `bootstrap.php` file, allowing it to be accessed directly via a web request.
- **`display_errors` enabled:** The `bootstrap.php` file has the `display_errors` setting enabled, which is not recommended for production environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The direct impact is the exposure of the web application's full file path, which is considered sensitive information.
- **Aids in Further Attacks:** While the disclosed path itself is not immediately dangerous, it can be used by attackers to aid in other attacks. For example, knowing the path can help an attacker craft specific file access attempts or exploit other vulnerabilities where knowledge of the file system is beneficial.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can directly request the vulnerable `bootstrap.php` file through a web browser or other HTTP client to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the `No Update Nag` plugin up to and including version 1.4.12 are vulnerable.
- **No Patch Available:** There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:** The provided content recommends uninstalling the plugin as the best course of action.

**Summary**

The `No Update Nag` plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure vulnerability because it exposes the `bootstrap.php` file with `display_errors` enabled. This allows an attacker to retrieve the full path of the web application through a direct HTTP request to the vulnerable file.
