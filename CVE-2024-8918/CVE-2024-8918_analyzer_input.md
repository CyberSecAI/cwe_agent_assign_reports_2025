# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8918

## Vulnerability Description
The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This is due to a **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with permissions granted by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**
- **weakness:** **Cross-Site Scripting**
- **impact:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting
- **vector:** Limited JavaScript File Upload
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 8.3.9

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on allowed file types within the File Manager Pro plugin. Specifically, it does not prevent the upload of potentially malicious files like .css and .js.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin fails to adequately restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, allowing for the upload of JavaScript and CSS files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper validation on file extensions being uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious .js or .css files, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including but not limited to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Data theft
- The impact is classified as high with potential for High Confidentiality and Integrity impact, and no Availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users, if the administrator has not restricted the necessary permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the target website.
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files. This is possible when administrator has not restricted required permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in File Manager Pro versions up to and including 8.3.9.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.3.10 and later.
- The CVSS score is 7.4 (High) with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
