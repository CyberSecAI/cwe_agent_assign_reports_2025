## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing/timerlat Drop interface_lock in stop_kthread() stop_kthread() is the offline callback for trace/osnoiseonline, since commit 5bfbcd1ee57b (tracing/timerlat Add interface_lock around clearing of kthread in stop_kthread()), the following **ABBA deadlock scenario** is introduced T1 | T2 [BP] | T3 [AP] osnoise_hotplug_workfn() | work_for_cpu_fn() | cpuhp_thread_fun() | _cpu_down() | osnoise_cpu_die() mutex_lock(&interface_lock) | | stop_kthread() | cpus_write_lock() | mutex_lock(&interface_lock) cpus_read_lock() | cpuhp_kick_ap() | As the interface_lock here in just for protecting the kthread field of the osn_var, use xchg() instead to fix this issue. Also use for_each_online_cpu() back in stop_per_cpu_kthreads() as it can take cpu_read_lock() again.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **ABBA deadlock scenario**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** tracing/timerlat

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a deadlock caused by the introduction of `interface_lock` in the `stop_kthread()` function within the `trace_osnoise.c` file. This lock was added in commit `5bfbcd1ee57b` to protect the `kthread` field when being cleared. However, this introduced a potential ABBA deadlock scenario involving `interface_lock`, `cpus_write_lock`, and `cpus_read_lock`.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**

-   **ABBA Deadlock:** The core weakness is the ABBA deadlock scenario, where multiple threads attempt to acquire locks in different orders, leading to a standstill. Specifically, the scenario involves:
    -   Thread 1 (T1) holding `interface_lock` and attempting to acquire `cpus_read_lock`.
    -   Thread 2 (T2) holding `cpus_write_lock` and attempting to acquire `interface_lock` via `stop_kthread()`.
    -   Thread 3 (T3) is also trying to acquire interface_lock.

-   **Overuse of mutex:** The use of a mutex for a simple operation (clearing the kthread field) was an overkill, especially when an atomic operation could suffice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **System Hang:** The deadlock results in a system hang, as the involved threads become blocked indefinitely. This prevents the system from responding or proceeding with normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is not directly exploitable via a traditional "attack vector," but rather a flaw in the synchronization logic that is triggered by normal system events such as CPU hotplug operations (specifically, CPU going offline).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed. The vulnerability is triggered during normal system operation when a CPU is taken offline, which causes `stop_kthread` to be called. The conditions for deadlock can arise from normal system events, which trigger the sequence of operations.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability resides in `kernel/trace/trace_osnoise.c`.
-   The faulty code was introduced in commit `5bfbcd1ee57b` and fixed by replacing the mutex operation with `xchg_relaxed()` and using `for_each_online_cpu()` in `stop_per_cpu_kthreads()`.
-   The specific deadlock scenario involves `osnoise_hotplug_workfn()`, `work_for_cpu_fn()`, and `cpuhp_thread_fun()`, which represent CPU hotplug events, and related work queues interacting with the problematic locking in `stop_kthread()`.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is resolved by:
-   Using atomic `xchg_relaxed()` operation instead of mutex to clear the kthread field, which removes the need for `interface_lock`
-   Using `for_each_online_cpu()` instead of `for_each_possible_cpu()` to iterate through the CPUs.

The provided content contains patches that address this issue by removing the `interface_lock` and using atomic operations, effectively resolving the deadlock.

**In Summary:** The provided information describes a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's tracing subsystem, specifically related to the `trace_osnoise` functionality. The deadlock occurs due to a race condition involving mutexes and CPU hotplug operations. The provided patches replace the mutex with an atomic operation to address the root cause.
