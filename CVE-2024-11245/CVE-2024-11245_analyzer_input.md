# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11245

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects Farmacia 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /editar-produto.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** Farmacia
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /editar-produto.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct inclusion of the user-controlled `id` parameter from the HTTP request into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization in the `editar-produto.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
* Obtain sensitive database information, such as table names and data.
* Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
* Depending on the database server permissions, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a simple HTTP GET request where the `id` parameter is manipulated with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `editar-produto.php` script. No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability since the application is directly concatenating the user provided data to the query.
