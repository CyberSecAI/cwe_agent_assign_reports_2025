# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-30356

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30356

## Description

CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier, a **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an **incomplete validation check** on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** in a memcpy call.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** incomplete validation check
- **Weakness:** heap buffer overflow
- **Impact:** overflow
- **Vector:** malicious frames
- **Product:** CryptoLib
- **Version:** 1.3.3 and earlier
- **Component:** Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is identified as CWE-191 Integer Underflow. This can lead to CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, where a negative value is misinterpreted as a large positive value due to conversion to an unsigned integer, ultimately causing the overflow.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an incomplete validation check on the frame length (`fl`). This leads to an Integer Underflow (CWE-191) when calculating `tf_payload_len`. Because `tf_payload_len` is cast to an unsigned integer, the negative value wraps around to a large positive value. This large value is then used in a `memcpy` call, leading to a Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-787), resulting in a potential denial of service or remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases highlight the "**incomplete validation check**" as the root cause, leading to a "**heap buffer overflow**". The CVE summary explicitly mentions both "**Integer underflow (CWE-191)**" and "**Heap buffer overflow (CWE-787)**".

The relationship graph illustrates how the Integer Underflow can precede and lead to an Out-of-bounds Write. The selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing the most specific representation of the vulnerability.

CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-787. CWE-190 Integer Overflow was also considered but not selected because the vulnerability involves an underflow, not an overflow. CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input was considered, but the root cause is more specifically an integer underflow than a general lack of validation.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
