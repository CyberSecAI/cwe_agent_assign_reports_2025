Repeated queries to non-existent endpoints inflate metrics storage and processing, consuming excessive resources. This issue can lead to monitoring system degradation, increased disk usage, and potential service unavailability. Since the issue does not require authentication, an external attacker can exhaust CPU, RAM, and disk space, impacting both application and cluster stability.",
