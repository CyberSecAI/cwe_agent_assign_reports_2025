## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf devmap provide rxq after redirect rxq contains a pointer to the device from where the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP* does not have it set. This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g. SEC(xdp) int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt) { return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0) } SEC(xdp/devmap) int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt) { bpf_printk(ifindex %i, pkt->ingress_ifindex) return XDP_PASS } depends on access to rxq, so a **NULL pointer gets dereferenced** [ 574.475170]

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **NULL pointer gets dereferenced**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** bpf devmap

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is that, after a redirect via `BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP`, the BPF program executed after the redirect does not have the `rxq` (receive queue) field set in the `xdp_buff` structure. The `rxq` field should contain a pointer to the device from where the redirect originated. This is an issue because BPF programs, particularly those accessing fields like `ingress_ifindex` depend on the `rxq` pointer and lead to a null pointer dereference if it is not set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing `rxq` Initialization:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly initialize the `rxq` field within the `xdp_buff` structure before executing the redirected BPF program.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** As a consequence of the missing `rxq` initialization, accessing `pkt->ingress_ifindex` in the BPF program leads to dereferencing a NULL pointer, causing a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic:** The immediate impact is a kernel panic, causing the system to crash and become unavailable. This is due to the null pointer dereference when accessing a member of the `rxq`.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The kernel panic effectively results in a denial-of-service, as the system is rendered unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **BPF Program Redirection:** The attack vector involves crafting a BPF program that redirects network packets using `bpf_redirect_map` to another device's queue.
*   **Triggering the Vulnerable BPF program:** The BPF program set to run after the redirect is triggered, this program then attempts to access the `ingress_ifindex` field of the `xdp_md` structure, causing the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Load BPF Programs:** The attacker needs the ability to load and execute BPF programs on the targeted system, typically requiring root privileges or specific capabilities.
*   **Network Interface Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets that will trigger the redirection logic and cause the vulnerable code path to execute.
*   **Knowledge of Target Environment:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target network setup and the relevant device maps, to redirect packets to a device which will trigger the vulnerable BPF program.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Fix:** The fix involves modifying the `dev_map_bpf_prog_run` function in `kernel/bpf/devmap.c` to correctly set the `rxq` field before running the redirected BPF program. The `rxq` is set using the `rx_dev` net device. This fix is implemented via the provided patches
*   **Affected Code:** The vulnerability resides in the BPF subsystem, specifically within the devmap functionality of the Linux kernel, impacting versions prior to the fix.

In summary, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference triggered in a BPF program after a redirection due to a missing `rxq` field. An attacker able to load BPF programs can craft a program that triggers a kernel panic by using `bpf_redirect_map` and then accessing the `ingress_ifindex` field, which leads to DoS. The provided patches correctly initialize the rxq field and resolve the issue.
