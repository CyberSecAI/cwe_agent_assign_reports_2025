## Vulnerability Description
A potential denial of service vulnerability is present in versions of Apache CXF before 3.5.10, 3.6.5 and 4.0.6. In some edge cases, the CachedOutputStream instances may not be closed and, if backed by temporary files, may fill up the file system (it applies to servers and clients).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** Apache CXF
- **version:** before 3.5.10, 3.6.5 and 4.0.6
- **component:** CachedOutputStream instances

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-23184 Analysis

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-23184. Here's an extraction of relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from `CachedOutputStream` instances not always being closed, and when backed by temporary files, potentially filling up the file system. Specifically, the `maybeDeleteTempFile` method doesn't always remove the temporary file as intended.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Resource exhaustion (disk space) due to unclosed temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) â€“ the server or client could become unresponsive due to disk space exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing a large number of requests that trigger the creation of temporary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected Apache CXF application. No special privileges are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.5.10 or later.
*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.6.5 or later.
*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 4.0.6 or later.

**Affected versions:**

*   Apache CXF before 3.5.10
*   Apache CXF 3.6.0 before 3.6.5
*   Apache CXF 4.0.0 before 4.0.6

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The issue is tracked as CXF-7396.
*   The problem occurs when `streamList.remove(stream)` fails, leading to incorrect checks for empty stream lists.
*   The issue seems to be exacerbated by processing many large requests in a row.
*   Attachments to the Jira issue (CXF-7396) contain diagnostic information (HTTP Request.jmx, screenshots).
