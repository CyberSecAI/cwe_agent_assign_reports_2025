## Vulnerability Description
D-Link DI-8300 v16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to **command injection** via the upgrade_filter_asp function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** D-Link DI-8300
- **version:** v16.07.26A1
- **component:** upgrade_filter_asp function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-44410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `upgrade_filter_asp` function. The function takes a `path` parameter via a GET request and uses this parameter to construct a system command. It only checks if the first seven characters are "http://", and proceeds without filtering the remaining characters, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the D-Link device.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  This level of access could lead to complete control of the affected device, enabling the attacker to:
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data
    *   Modify device configurations
    *   Install malware
    *   Use the device as part of a botnet

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request targeting the `upgrade_filter.asp` endpoint.
*   **`path` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `path` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the D-Link device. This likely requires being on the same network or having external access through a port forward or other means.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** The provided PoC code includes cookies for authentication, suggesting that the attacker may need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. However, the description does not explicitly state that authentication is required for the command injection itself.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Firmware:** The vulnerability affects D-Link DI-8300A1 devices with firmware version DI\_8300-16.07.26A1
*   **Exploitation Example:** The provided example shows how to inject a command to list running processes (`ps > /002.txt`) and how to read the /etc/passwd file.
