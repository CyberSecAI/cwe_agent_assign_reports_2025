TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl.

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption.

The PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their required library version, they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-691 (ChildOf)",

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled). This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-28201: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion, because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.\n\n- CVE-2022-28773: Due to an uncontrolled recursion in SAP Web Dispatcher and SAP Internet Communication Manager, the application may crash, leading to denial of service, but can be restarted automatically. \n\n- CVE-2022-31173: Juniper is a GraphQL server library for Rust. Affected versions of Juniper are vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion resulting in a program crash. This issue has been addressed in version 0.15.10. Users are advised to upgrade.

In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2018-16069: Chain: series of floating-point precision errors (CWE-1339) in a web browser rendering engine causes out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), giving access to cross-origin data\n\n- CVE-2017-7619: Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n- CVE-2021-29529: Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)\n\n- CVE-2008-2108: Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)\n\n- CVE-2006-6499: Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\"\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-190 (PeerOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-119 (CanPrecede)",

There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.

In affected versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.\n\n- CVE-2022-31016: Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. Argo CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-31080: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-35922: Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust. In versions prior to 0.26.5 untrusted websocket connections can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) process abort in a client or a server. The root cause of the issue is during dataframe parsing. Affected versions would allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe size, which may come from an untrusted source. When `Vec::with_capacity` fails to allocate, the default Rust allocator will abort the current process, killing all threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio) implementation. Async version also does not limit memory, but does not use `with_capacity`, so DoS can happen only when bytes for oversized dataframe or message actually got delivered by the attacker. The crashes are fixed in version 0.26.5 by imposing default dataframe size limits. Affected users are advised to update to this version. Users unable to upgrade are advised to filter websocket traffic externally or to only accept trusted traffic.\n\n- CVE-2022-41727: An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig.

In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.\n\n- CVE-2022-22228: An Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause an RPD memory leak leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This memory leak only occurs when the attacker's packets are destined to any configured IPv6 address on the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-32226: An improper access control vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 due to input data in the getUsersOfRoom Meteor server method is not type validated, so that MongoDB query operator objects are accepted by the server, so that instead of a matching rid String a$regex query can be executed, bypassing the room access permission check for every but the first matching room.\n\n- CVE-2021-0600: In onCreate of DeviceAdminAdd.java, there is a possible way to mislead a user to activate a device admin app due to improper input validation.

A user can supply any type of parameter that will be passed to inner calls without checking the type of the parameter or the value.\n\n- CVE-2021-43802: Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-44354: Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in the cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser functionality of Reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102.

If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\n- CVE-2022-42329: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nIt is frequently assumed that physical attacks such as fault injection and side-channel analysis require an attacker to have physical access to the target device. This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n",

TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V15 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V16 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V15 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V16 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V15 (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V16 (All versions < V16 Update 4), SINAMICS GH150 (All versions), SINAMICS GL150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS GM150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS SH150 (All versions), SINAMICS SL150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM120 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150i (All versions). A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-754 (ChildOf)",

Mapping a huge section filled with zeros of an ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-4190: Large loop in the Kafka dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-36083: JOSE is \"JSON Web Almost Everything\" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS with no dependencies using runtime's native crypto in Node.js, Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their required library version, they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-691 (ChildOf)",

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled). This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-28201: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion, because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.\n\n- CVE-2022-28773: Due to an uncontrolled recursion in SAP Web Dispatcher and SAP Internet Communication Manager, the application may crash, leading to denial of service, but can be restarted automatically. \n\n- CVE-2022-31173: Juniper is a GraphQL server library for Rust. Affected versions of Juniper are vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion resulting in a program crash. This issue has been addressed in version 0.15.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit the recursion depth manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-37315: graphql-go (aka GraphQL for Go) through 0.8.0 has infinite recursion in the type definition parser.\n\n- CVE-2022-41881: Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, a StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion. This issue is patched in version 4.1.86.Final. There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.\n\n- CVE-2022-27943: libiberty/rust-demangle.c in GNU GCC 11.2 allows stack consumption in demangle_const, as demonstrated by nm-new.\n\n- CVE-2022-40150: Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by Out of memory. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2018-16069: Chain: series of floating-point precision errors (CWE-1339) in a web browser rendering engine causes out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), giving access to cross-origin data\n\n- CVE-2017-7619: Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n- CVE-2021-29529: Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)\n\n- CVE-2008-2108: Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)\n\n- CVE-2006-6499: Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\"\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-190 (PeerOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-119 (CanPrecede)",

All users of Bzip2Decoder are affected. The malicious input can trigger an OOME and so a DoS attack\n\n- CVE-2021-37137: The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.\n\n- CVE-2021-44590: In libming 0.4.8, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exist in the function cws2fws in util/main.c. Remote attackers could launch denial of service attacks by submitting a crafted SWF file that exploits this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23524: Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, resulting in Denial of Service. Input to functions in the _strvals_ package can cause a stack overflow. In Go, a stack overflow cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-46877: jackson-databind 2.10.x through 2.12.x before 2.12.6 and 2.13.x before 2.13.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (2 GB transient heap usage per read) in uncommon situations involving JsonNode JDK serialization.\n\n- CVE-2022-22226: In VxLAN scenarios on EX4300-MP, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices an Uncontrolled Memory Allocation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated adjacently located attacker sending specific packets to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by crashing one or more PFE's when they are received and processed by the device. Upon automatic restart of the PFE, continued processing of these packets will cause the memory leak to reappear. Depending on the volume of packets received the attacker may be able to create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4300-MP, EX4600, QFX5000 Series: 17.1 version 17.1R1 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S6, 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S1; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2.

An information leak might occur but there is a simple denial of service (memory exhaustion) upon an attempt to parse a large or infinite file (such as a block or character device).\n\n- CVE-2022-3212: <bytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request would not, by default, set a limit for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of memory and crash. This also applies to these extractors which used Bytes::from_request internally: axum::extract::Form axum::extract::Json String\n\n- CVE-2021-28714: Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)\n\n- CVE-2021-28715: Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them.

In affected versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.\n\n- CVE-2022-31016: Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. Argo CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-31080: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-35922: Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust. In versions prior to 0.26.5 untrusted websocket connections can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) process abort in a client or a server. The root cause of the issue is during dataframe parsing. Affected versions would allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe size, which may come from an untrusted source. When `Vec::with_capacity` fails to allocate, the default Rust allocator will abort the current process, killing all threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio) implementation. Async version also does not limit memory, but does not use `with_capacity`, so DoS can happen only when bytes for oversized dataframe or message actually got delivered by the attacker. The crashes are fixed in version 0.26.5 by imposing default dataframe size limits. Affected users are advised to update to this version. Users unable to upgrade are advised to filter websocket traffic externally or to only accept trusted traffic.\n\n- CVE-2022-41727: An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig. This could lead to a denial of service.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-770 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-476 (CanPrecede)",

A malicious user could use a Go object with specific string to potentially inject additional fields into marshalled documents. This issue affects all MongoDB GO Drivers prior to and including 1.5.0. \n\n- CVE-2021-29486: cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.\n\n- CVE-2022-22228: An Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause an RPD memory leak leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This memory leak only occurs when the attacker's packets are destined to any configured IPv6 address on the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-32226: An improper access control vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 due to input data in the getUsersOfRoom Meteor server method is not type validated, so that MongoDB query operator objects are accepted by the server, so that instead of a matching rid String a$regex query can be executed, bypassing the room access permission check for every but the first matching room.\n\n- CVE-2021-0600: In onCreate of DeviceAdminAdd.java, there is a possible way to mislead a user to activate a device admin app due to improper input validation.

A user can supply any type of parameter that will be passed to inner calls without checking the type of the parameter or the value.\n\n- CVE-2021-43802: Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-44354: Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in the cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser functionality of Reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102.

This can produce resultant vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1395:** Certain packets (zero byte and other lengths) cause a recvfrom call to produce an unexpected return code that causes a server's listening loop to exit.\n- **CVE-2002-2124:** Unchecked return code from recv() leads to infinite loop.\n- **CVE-2005-2553:** Kernel function does not properly handle when a null is returned by a function call, causing it to call another function that it shouldn't.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.\n- **CVE-2006-6499:** Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. \n\n\nThere are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\nCanPrecede -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2018-16069:** Chain: series of floating-point precision errors (CWE-1339) in a web browser rendering engine causes out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), giving access to cross-origin data\n- **CVE-2017-7619:** Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)\n- **CVE-2021-29529:** Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1050: Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product has a loop body or loop condition that contains a control element that directly or\n\t\t\t\t\tindirectly consumes platform resources, e.g. messaging, sessions, locks, or file\n\t\t\t\t\tdescriptors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly. If an attacker can influence the number of iterations in the loop, then this performance problem might allow a denial of service by consuming more platform resources than intended.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation or calling blocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations or require a successful network operation.\n\n\nDue to limitations in multi-thread models, single-threaded models are used to overcome the resource constraints that are caused by using many threads. In such a model, all code should generally be non-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will effectively be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous. Such models are used in Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other custom event loop code.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-835\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could be argued that even \"normal\" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as \"stack exhaustion,\" which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nUncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault\n- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field\n\n",

TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V15 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V16 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V15 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V16 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V15 (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V16 (All versions < V16 Update 4), SINAMICS GH150 (All versions), SINAMICS GL150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS GM150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS SH150 (All versions), SINAMICS SL150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM120 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150i (All versions). A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-754 (ChildOf)",

Mapping a huge section filled with zeros of an ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-4190: Large loop in the Kafka dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-36083: JOSE is \"JSON Web Almost Everything\" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS with no dependencies using runtime's native crypto in Node.js, Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their required library version, they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-691 (ChildOf)",

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled). This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-28201: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion, because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.\n\n- CVE-2022-28773: Due to an uncontrolled recursion in SAP Web Dispatcher and SAP Internet Communication Manager, the application may crash, leading to denial of service, but can be restarted automatically. \n\n- CVE-2022-31173: Juniper is a GraphQL server library for Rust. Affected versions of Juniper are vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion resulting in a program crash. This issue has been addressed in version 0.15.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit the recursion depth manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-37315: graphql-go (aka GraphQL for Go) through 0.8.0 has infinite recursion in the type definition parser.\n\n- CVE-2022-41881: Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, a StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion. This issue is patched in version 4.1.86.Final. There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.\n\n- CVE-2022-27943: libiberty/rust-demangle.c in GNU GCC 11.2 allows stack consumption in demangle_const, as demonstrated by nm-new.\n\n- CVE-2022-40150: Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by Out of memory. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2018-16069: Chain: series of floating-point precision errors (CWE-1339) in a web browser rendering engine causes out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), giving access to cross-origin data\n\n- CVE-2017-7619: Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n- CVE-2021-29529: Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)\n\n- CVE-2008-2108: Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)\n\n- CVE-2006-6499: Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\"\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-190 (PeerOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-119 (CanPrecede)",

SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-46877: jackson-databind 2.10.x through 2.12.x before 2.12.6 and 2.13.x before 2.13.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (2 GB transient heap usage per read) in uncommon situations involving JsonNode JDK serialization.\n\n- CVE-2022-22226: In VxLAN scenarios on EX4300-MP, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices an Uncontrolled Memory Allocation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated adjacently located attacker sending specific packets to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by crashing one or more PFE's when they are received and processed by the device. Upon automatic restart of the PFE, continued processing of these packets will cause the memory leak to reappear. Depending on the volume of packets received the attacker may be able to create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4300-MP, EX4600, QFX5000 Series: 17.1 version 17.1R1 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S6, 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S1; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2.

There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.

In affected versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.\n\n- CVE-2022-31016: Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. Argo CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-31080: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-35922: Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust. In versions prior to 0.26.5 untrusted websocket connections can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) process abort in a client or a server. The root cause of the issue is during dataframe parsing. Affected versions would allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe size, which may come from an untrusted source. When `Vec::with_capacity` fails to allocate, the default Rust allocator will abort the current process, killing all threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio) implementation. Async version also does not limit memory, but does not use `with_capacity`, so DoS can happen only when bytes for oversized dataframe or message actually got delivered by the attacker. The crashes are fixed in version 0.26.5 by imposing default dataframe size limits. Affected users are advised to update to this version. Users unable to upgrade are advised to filter websocket traffic externally or to only accept trusted traffic.\n\n- CVE-2022-41727: An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig.

A malicious user could use a Go object with specific string to potentially inject additional fields into marshalled documents. This issue affects all MongoDB GO Drivers prior to and including 1.5.0. \n\n- CVE-2021-29486: cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.\n\n- CVE-2022-22228: An Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause an RPD memory leak leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This memory leak only occurs when the attacker's packets are destined to any configured IPv6 address on the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-32226: An improper access control vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 due to input data in the getUsersOfRoom Meteor server method is not type validated, so that MongoDB query operator objects are accepted by the server, so that instead of a matching rid String a$regex query can be executed, bypassing the room access permission check for every but the first matching room.\n\n- CVE-2021-0600: In onCreate of DeviceAdminAdd.java, there is a possible way to mislead a user to activate a device admin app due to improper input validation.

A user can supply any type of parameter that will be passed to inner calls without checking the type of the parameter or the value.\n\n- CVE-2021-43802: Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-44354: Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in the cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser functionality of Reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102.

This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n",
