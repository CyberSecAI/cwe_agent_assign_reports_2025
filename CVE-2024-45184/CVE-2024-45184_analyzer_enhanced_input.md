## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45184.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists, allowing for an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly specified, but the presence of a heap buffer overflow indicates it would involve writing data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path which leads to the heap overflow condition. The specific capabilities and position required are not detailed in the provided text.
