The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure** while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47941:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- An out-of-bounds read occurs when parsing specially crafted PAR files within the affected Solid Edge application. The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory structure.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The vulnerability stems from the software reading memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer when processing a PAR file, potentially leading to unintended behavior.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This implies the attacker could potentially take full control of the affected system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the Solid Edge application opens a specially crafted PAR file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious PAR file using the vulnerable Solid Edge application. This suggests that the attacker likely needs to deliver a specially crafted file to the user and leverage social engineering or other methods for the user to open the file.\n- **Local Access:** This vulnerability has an attack vector of \"Local\" (AV:L). However, that simply means the user must open the file on their local machine, regardless of where the file itself came from.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- This vulnerability is specific to Solid Edge SE2024 versions prior to Update 9 (V224.0).\n- A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 and a CVSS v4.0 base score of 7.3 indicate a high severity.\n- Siemens recommends updating to version V224.0 Update 9 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.\n- A workaround for this vulnerability is to avoid opening untrusted PAR files in the affected applications.",

CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, is considered as a secondary candidate due to the potential for a write operation following the read. CWE-119, **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, is a class-level CWE and a parent of both CWE-125 and CWE-787 but is discouraged due to its generality. The relationships show that an **Out-of-bounds Read** can precede an **Out-of-bounds Write** when the application continues to process the corrupted data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the parsing of a specially crafted PAR file. This leads to an **out of bounds read** (CWE-125) when the application attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer. The **out of bounds read** can potentially lead to an **out of bounds write** (CWE-787), and ultimately, the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125, **Out-of-bounds Read**, as the vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure**. This is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which identifies the root cause as an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted PAR files. The description also notes the impact could be arbitrary code execution. The similar CVE descriptions also strongly point to CWE-125 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, is considered as a secondary candidate because an out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write if the application continues to process the corrupted data and attempts to write it back to memory. However, the primary issue is the read itself.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-119, **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, is a more general category that includes both reads and writes. Since the description specifically mentions a read, CWE-125 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence that the vulnerability is an **out of bounds read**, which directly matches the description of CWE-125. The relationship analysis also supports this selection, as CWE-125 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
