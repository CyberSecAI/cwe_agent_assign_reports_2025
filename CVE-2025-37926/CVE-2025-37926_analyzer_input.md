    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'use-after-free in ksmbd_session_rpc_open'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 330.09)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 301.67)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 297.07)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 4. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 295.29)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 5. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 290.20)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...
