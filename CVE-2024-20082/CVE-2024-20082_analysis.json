The primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) due to the **memory corruption** and the **missing bounds check**.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"In Modem, there is a possible **memory corruption** due to a **missing bounds check**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this: \"Root cause: **Missing bounds check** in the Modem component.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-787 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered as a secondary weakness because a read operation might precede the write operation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they are Base level CWEs that directly address the root cause (**missing bounds check**) and the resulting weakness (**memory corruption**).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
