# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11563

## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24860.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. This lack of validation allows a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*  **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious DXF file or visit a malicious webpage that causes the vulnerable IrfanView to parse a crafted file. User interaction is required.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to deliver or have the victim open a malicious DXF file or have them visit a malicious webpage.
