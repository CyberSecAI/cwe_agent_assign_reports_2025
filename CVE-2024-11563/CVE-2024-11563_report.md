# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11563

## Description

IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24860.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** Out-Of-Bounds Read
- **Impact:** ['execute arbitrary code', 'execute code in the context of the current process', 'remote code execution']
- **Vector:** malicious page or file
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Product:** IrfanView
- **Component:** DXF File Parsing

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read], which stems from CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation]. CWE-125 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, and while it's the **rootcause**, it's less specific than CWE-125, which describes the actual read past the buffer. The relationship shows that missing input validation can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** (CWE-125). This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) -> Arbitrary Code Execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds read due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. The primary CWE is CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read], as it describes the specific weakness. CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] is a contributing factor (**rootcause**), but CWE-125 is a more precise description of the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-125 as a highly relevant CWE. The description explicitly states "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer."

Other CWEs Considered:
*   CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write]: While similar to CWE-125, the description explicitly mentions an "Out-Of-Bounds Read", making CWE-125 a more accurate fit.
*   CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound]: This CWE is related to integer handling issues, but the description focuses on input validation and out-of-bounds access, not integer overflows.
*   CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input]: This CWE is similar to CWE-20, but focuses specifically on quantities. The vulnerability is more general and doesn't specify a quantity, so CWE-20 is a better fit.
*   CWE-122 [Heap-based Buffer Overflow] and CWE-121 [Stack-based Buffer Overflow]: These CWEs specify the location of the buffer overflow (heap or stack). The description does not provide this level of detail.
*   CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]: This is a parent class of CWE-125, and while related, CWE-125 is more specific to the vulnerability.
