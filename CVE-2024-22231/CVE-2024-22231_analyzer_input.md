## Vulnerability Description
Syndic cache directory creation is vulnerable to a **directory traversal attack** in salt project which can lead a malicious attacker to create an arbitrary directory on a Salt master.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **directory traversal attack**
- **impact:** create an arbitrary directory
- **attacker:** malicious attacker
- **product:** salt
- **component:** Syndic cache directory creation

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The syndic cache directory creation process is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Directory traversal vulnerability in the syndic cache directory creation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create arbitrary directories on the Salt master.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of the syndic cache directory. The exact method of exploiting the directory traversal is not detailed, but it is implied that it involves crafting a malicious path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L), which indicates they need some level of access to interact with the Salt master. The attack is network-based (AV:N) and requires no user interaction (UI:N).
