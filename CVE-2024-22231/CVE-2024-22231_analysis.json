The exact method of exploiting the directory traversal is not detailed, but it is implied that it involves crafting a malicious path.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L), which indicates they need some level of access to interact with the Salt master. The attack is network-based (AV:N) and requires no user interaction (UI:N).",
