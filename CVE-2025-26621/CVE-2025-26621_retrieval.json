The second content snippet explicitly identifies the CVE ID. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability of users with the `manage customizations` capability to edit webhooks and execute JavaScript code within them.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Prototype pollution in the JavaScript execution within webhooks.\\n*   Improper input validation/sanitization of JavaScript code in webhooks.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation leads to a denial of service by crashing the Node.js server running the OpenCTI frontend.\\n*   Related to, and a complementary fix for, a more severe Remote Code Execution vulnerability (GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm).\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   Network-based: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\\n*   Requires a user account with the `manage customizations` capability.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   An attacker needs a user account with the `manage customizations` capability.\\n*   Knowledge of JavaScript and prototype pollution techniques.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   Upgrade to version 6.5.2 or later.\\n*   The fix addresses the ability to cause a denial of service through prototype pollution.\\n\\n**CVSS v3 Metrics:**\\n\\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network (N)\\n*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (L)\\n*   **Privileges Required:** High (H)\\n*   **User Interaction:** None (N)\\n*   **Scope:** Changed (C)\\n*   **Confidentiality:** None (N)\\n*   **Integrity:** Low (L)\\n*   **Availability:** High (H)\\n*   **Overall Score:** 7.6 (High)\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\nThe content clarifies that this vulnerability is related to a previous, more critical vulnerability (GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm) involving remote code execution and sensitive secrets exposure.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.5.2, any user with the capability manage customizations can edit webhook that will execute javascript code. This can be abused to cause a denial of service attack by ****prototype pollution****, making the node js server running the OpenCTI frontend become unavailable. Version 6.5.2 fixes the issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'prototype pollution'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
