  "description": "A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the behavior of default system policies, such as quality of service (QoS) policies, on an affected system.&nbspThis vulnerability is due to **improper access control** when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.",

This can disrupt network traffic, as these policies are used by all tenants in the fabric.\n- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain with **port-mgmt** permissions.",

CWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control) is also related to CWE-284, suggesting that the authorization problem might stem from overly broad access controls. The vulnerability description clearly points to an authorization issue, making CWE-863 a more specific choice than the broader CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe1220 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** in the restricted security domain implementation, leading to **incorrect authorization**. This allows an attacker to modify default system policies, ultimately disrupting network traffic.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Access Control** leading to **Incorrect Authorization**\n  - **Weakness:** Ability to modify default system policies\n  - **Impact:** Disruption of network traffic\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **improper access control** as the root cause. However, the more precise weakness is that the authorization check is performed incorrectly, allowing unauthorized modification of policies. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 as a highly relevant candidate. CWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control) is included as a secondary CWE because it might explain the underlying reason for the incorrect authorization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** mechanism described in the vulnerability. The guidance discourages the use of the higher-level CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) when more specific CWEs like CWE-863 are applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
