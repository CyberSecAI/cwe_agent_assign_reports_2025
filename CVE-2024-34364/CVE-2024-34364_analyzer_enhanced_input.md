## Vulnerability Description
Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Envoy exposed an out-of-memory (OOM) vector from the mirror response, since async HTTP client will buffer the response with an unbounded buffer.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** out-of-memory (OOM)
- **product:** Envoy

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Envoy's async HTTP client handles mirror responses. It buffers the entire response in memory without any limits, leading to potential out-of-memory (OOM) conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unbounded Buffer:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a size limit on the buffer used to store mirror responses. This allows a malicious backend to send extremely large responses, which will be fully buffered.
- **Vulnerable Components:**  Multiple components within Envoy that utilize the HTTP async client are susceptible, including:
    - wasm filter
    - lua filter
    - ext_proc
    - oauth filter
    - ext_authz
    - jwks_fetcher
    - gcp_auther_filter
    - aws_metadata_fetcher
    - opentelemetry/http_trace_exporter
    - opentelemetry/dynatrace/sampler_config_provider
    - config_subscription/rest/rest_api_fetcher
    - rate_limiter

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an out-of-memory error in Envoy.
- **OOM:**  The Envoy process will be terminated due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Backend:** A malicious backend server sending large HTTP response messages to a mirror service.
- The vulnerability is network-based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP responses to a service that is being mirrored by Envoy.
- **Control over Mirrored Backend:** The attacker must have control of the backend service that is being mirrored, allowing them to send arbitrarily large responses.
- **Low Privileges:** Low privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction**: User interaction is required to initiate the request that triggers the mirroring.

**Mitigation:**

- **Disable Mirror Response Buffering:** Patched versions disable buffering for mirror responses, as Envoy does not use them.
- **Configurable Buffer Limit:** Provide a configuration option for the HTTP async client that includes a hard limit on buffer size. This limit can be set through a runtime key.

**CVSS Score:**
- Moderate: 5.7
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field




## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.

### Extended Description
An example of data amplification is a "decompression bomb," a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-405

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-1955:** XML bomb in web server module
- **CVE-2003-1564:** Parsing library allows XML bomb




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description


This Pillar covers several possibilities:


  - the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;

  - the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;

  - the comparison checks the wrong factor.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.
**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.


**[Maintenance]** This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)
- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning
- **CVE-2016-10003:** Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak




## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

### Extended Description


HTTP requests or responses ("messages") can be malformed or unexpected in ways that cause web servers or clients to interpret the messages in different ways than intermediary HTTP agents such as load balancers, reverse proxies, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc. For example, an adversary may be able to add duplicate or different header fields that a client or server might interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary might interpret the same sequence of bytes as a different set of messages. For example, discrepancies can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers for TE and CL.


The inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow the adversary to "smuggle" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.


This weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Request smuggling can be performed due to a multiple interpretation error, where the target is an intermediary or monitor, via a consistency manipulation (Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24766:** SSL/TLS-capable proxy allows HTTP smuggling when used in tandem with HTTP/1.0 services, due to inconsistent interpretation and input sanitization of HTTP messages within the body of another message
- **CVE-2021-37147:** Chain: caching proxy server has improper input validation (CWE-20) of headers, allowing HTTP response smuggling (CWE-444) using an "LF line ending"
- **CVE-2020-8287:** Node.js platform allows request smuggling via two Transfer-Encoding headers




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.

- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the "classic" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.

### Alternative Terms
Classic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-123
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions "buffer overflow" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for "Buffer Copy" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.
**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.

**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called "buffer overflows" are substantively different than the "classic" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument
- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable
- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a ">" but does not decrement for "<"




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.
