# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39934

## Vulnerability Description
Robotmk before 2.0.1 allows a local user to escalate privileges (e.g., to SYSTEM) if automated Python environment setup is enabled, because the **shared holotree usage feature** allows any user to edit any Python environment.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **shared holotree usage feature**
- **impact:** escalate privileges to SYSTEM
- **vector:** automated Python environment setup
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** Robotmk
- **version:** before 2.0.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in Werk #16434, which is associated with CVE-2024-39934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Robotmk scheduler, when configured to use automated environment setup via RCC, enabled a feature called "shared holotree usage". This allowed any user on the host to modify the Python environments created by RCC.
- The Robotmk scheduler is started by the Checkmk agent, which runs with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation via Shared Holotree:**
    -   The "shared holotree" feature allows any user to modify Python environments created by Robotmk's automated setup.
    -   A compromised user could modify these shared environments and inject malicious code.
    -   Because the scheduler runs with SYSTEM privileges, this malicious code would execute with elevated privileges.
    - If a plan was not configured to `Execute plan as a specific user`, the malicious code would execute under the SYSTEM account leading to SYSTEM privilege escalation.

2.  **Privilege Escalation Between Users:**
    - If multiple plans were configured with `Execute plan as a specific user` with distinct users
    -   If one of those users was compromised, the attacker could modify shared environments to target the other user and escalate to the other user's privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **SYSTEM Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain full control of the host if a plan was not configured to `Execute plan as a specific user`.
-   **User Compromise:** An attacker could compromise specific user accounts configured in `Execute plan as a specific user`, if a plan was configured to use this setting.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   A compromised user on the host where the Robotmk scheduler is deployed is required.
-   The attacker needs to modify the shared Python environments created by RCC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must have compromised an account on the host where the Robotmk scheduler is running.
-   The attacker needs the ability to modify the shared Python environment created by Robotmk

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by disabling "shared holotree usage" in Robotmk.
- Additionally, permissions in the working directory of Robotmk were reworked so that users only have access to the directories needed for their own executions.
- Users were advised to update both Checkmk and redeploy the latest Robotmk Scheduler.

**CVSS Score:**

-   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8 (High)
-   CVSS vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided GitHub diffs show the removal of the shared holotree enabling functionality from the `rcc.rs` file, and the change in `results.rs` to reflect the removal of `shared_holotree` result tracking. Additionally tests were updated to reflect the changes.
- The Werk mentions that users need to update both Checkmk and the Robotmk scheduler, indicating that the vulnerability was addressed in both components.
- The Werk also provides mitigations for users who cannot update immediately by suggesting they avoid using "Automated environment setup (via RCC)" or always use the same user for "Execute plan as a specific user."

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
