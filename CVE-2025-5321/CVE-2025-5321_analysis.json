  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-5321: The content is related to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Aim, an experiment tracking tool. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `RestrictedPythonQuery` class, which creates a restricted Python sandbox. An unsanitized `run_view` object is passed into the sandbox environment as part of the local namespace, exposing dangerous internal objects. Specifically, the `QueryRunSequenceCollection` class instantiates a `run_view` object and passes it to the sandbox via `self.query.check()`. This `run_view` object allows traversal to internal database sessions and ultimately to modules like `sys` and `os`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `run_view` object is not properly sanitized before being passed into the sandbox.\n*   **Insecure Deserialization/Object Access:** The complex `run_view` object provides access to internal database sessions and system modules.\n*   **Sandbox Escape:** The ability to access `sys` and `os` allows an attacker to escape the intended sandbox environment.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nRemote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability can be triggered via API endpoints:\n    *   `/api/runs/search/metric/`\n    *   `/api/runs/search/run`\n*   The `q` parameter in these endpoints accepts user-supplied query expressions that are evaluated inside the sandbox.\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious query to traverse the `run_view` object and execute system commands.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Aim API endpoints.\n*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided text, suggesting the vulnerability might be exploitable without authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, it implies that sanitizing the `run_view` object or restricting access to sensitive modules within the sandbox would be necessary to address the vulnerability.",

However, the CVE content summary clearly states that the unsanitized `run_view` object allows access to system modules, leading to remote code execution. This points directly to **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94) as the root cause. The erweiterte Rechte (extended rights) impact suggests that the injected code is being run with elevated privileges, hence CWE-267 is a secondary concern.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-94 is based on the direct evidence of code execution and the sandbox escape.
