  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA timer Dont take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user() The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often problematic when its called inside another mutex, as they might lead to **deadlocks**. In the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with guard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- which was mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had been carefully worked around in the past. This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() out of the register mutex lock again.",

CWE-667 and CWE-362 are related as they represent broader classes of concurrency issues. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) can lead to CWE-833. CWE-362 (Race Condition) can also contribute to concurrency problems that manifest as deadlocks. The abstraction levels guided the selection, preferring the Base level CWE-833 for the specific issue, while acknowledging the relevance of the higher-level Class CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the incorrect placement of `copy_from/to_user()` inside a mutex lock (`register_mutex`). This **improper locking** creates a situation where multiple threads or processes can get stuck waiting for each other to release the necessary locks, resulting in a **deadlock**.\n\nIncorrect Locking -> Deadlock\n\nThe root cause is the improper use of mutexes around the `copy_from/to_user()` calls. The impact is a **deadlock**, which can cause the system to become unresponsive.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary finding is CWE-833 (Deadlock) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **deadlocks**. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel ALSA timer code, where `copy_from/to_user()` calls are incorrectly placed inside a mutex lock, leading to potential **deadlocks**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is: \"The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often problematic when its called inside another mutex, as they might lead to **deadlocks**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), which are related to concurrency issues but are less specific than CWE-833.\n\nCWE-833 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **deadlock** condition, making CWE-833 the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
