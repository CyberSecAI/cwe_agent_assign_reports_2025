Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of OCPP messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-20 CWE-121 CWE-119 CWE-1284 CWE-787 CWE-294 CWE-306 CWE-78",
