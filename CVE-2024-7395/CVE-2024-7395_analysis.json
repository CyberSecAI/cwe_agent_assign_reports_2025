While the description mentions an **authentication bypass**, the root cause is the **missing authentication** for a critical function, making CWE-306 the more accurate and specific choice.

The retriever results also ranked CWE-306 highly, further supporting this choice.\n\nCWE-287 was considered but not used because it represents \"Improper Authentication,\" which implies that some form of authentication exists but is flawed. In this case, authentication is entirely missing, making CWE-306 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-288 was considered as a high level, secondary candidate because the vulnerability results in an Authentication Bypass.
