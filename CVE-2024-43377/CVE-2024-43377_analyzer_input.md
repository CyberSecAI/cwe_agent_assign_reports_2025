# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43377

## Vulnerability Description
Umbraco CMS is an ASP.NET CMS. An authenticated user can access a few unintended endpoints. This issue is fixed in 14.1.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access unintended endpoints
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** Umbraco CMS
- **version:** prior to 14.1.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43377:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the Umbraco Management API. Specifically, certain endpoints were not adequately protected, requiring only authentication rather than specific section access. This allowed authenticated members (users with member tokens) to access these unintended endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the failure to restrict access to sensitive API endpoints based on user roles and permissions. The system relied solely on authentication, which is insufficient for authorization.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The vulnerability exposed a weakness where authentication was mistakenly treated as sufficient for accessing several Management API endpoints, which should require back-office access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Low - An attacker can gain unauthorized access to information from the exposed endpoints which a member is not supposed to access.
- **Integrity:** Low - An attacker might be able to perform actions they shouldn't have access to via the exposed endpoints.
- **Availability:** None - The vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the application.
-Overall the impact was moderate due to the combination of the low confidentiality and integrity impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- Authenticated users: Any member who has a valid authentication token for the application can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in the Umbraco CMS system.
- No special privileges are needed, as even a standard authenticated member can exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Umbraco CMS versions greater than 14.0.0 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 14.1.2.
- The provided GitHub commit (72bef88) shows the code changes made to address this vulnerability, introducing a `BackOfficeRequirement` that checks if a user is both authenticated and has back-office access.
- The fix involved adding authorization policies specifically for back-office access using a new `BackOfficeHandler` and `BackOfficeRequirement`.
- The CVSS score is 5.4 (Moderate).
- CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
