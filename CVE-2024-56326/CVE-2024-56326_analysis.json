  "description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An **oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format** allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinjas sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they dont escape the sandbox. However, its possible to store a reference to a malicious strings format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The Jinja sandboxed environment failed to properly handle indirect calls to the `str.format` method. While direct calls to `str.format` were caught by the sandbox, it was possible to store a reference to a malicious string's `format` method and then pass it to a filter that would call it, bypassing the sandbox.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The sandbox did not fully sanitize or validate calls to `str.format` when invoked indirectly through a filter.\n- **Indirect Call Bypass:** The sandbox's checks were not comprehensive enough to detect and prevent indirect calls to methods like `str.format` from being used maliciously.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who controls the content of a Jinja template can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.\n- **Security Breach:** Exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application and the server hosting it.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Template Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious code into Jinja templates. This typically occurs when template content is dynamically constructed using user-supplied input.\n- **Custom Filters:** Attackers can leverage custom filters within the application's Jinja environment that might not be designed with security in mind to execute the malicious `format` method.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Template Control:** The attacker must have control over the content of a Jinja template. This could be through an application that takes user input and uses it to render a template.\n- **Custom Filter Access:**  The attacker would need to identify or create a scenario where a filter that accepts a callable argument is available and can then be used in conjunction with a stored reference to `str.format`\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n-   The fix involves ensuring that the sandboxed environment intercepts indirect calls to `str.format`, preventing the malicious execution.\n-   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability has a \"Moderate\" severity score of 5.4.\n-   The CVSS v4 base metrics indicates the following:\n    -   Attack Vector: Local\n    -   Attack Complexity: Low\n    -   Attack Requirements: Present\n    -   Privileges Required: Low\n    -   User Interaction: Passive\n    -   Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact: High\n    -   Subsequent System Impact: None\n\nThis vulnerability is related to the GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h advisory, which is a known security vulnerability in the Jinja2 templating engine.",

This indicates that CWE-1336 is a more specific case of code injection, focusing on template engines. The vulnerability description clearly points to a flaw within the Jinja template engine, making CWE-1336 the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format**. This **failure to properly neutralize** special elements within the template engine (CWE-1336) leads to the ability to execute arbitrary Python code, which can be considered a form of code injection (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and conclusion are strongly supported by the evidence provided. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **oversight in the Jinja sandboxed environment** related to `str.format` calls. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1336, which addresses the **improper neutralization of special elements in a template engine**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-1336 is a child of CWE-94, indicating that it's a more specific type of code injection. Since the vulnerability is clearly within a template engine, CWE-1336 is the most appropriate and specific choice. While CWE-94 is a valid secondary consideration, the primary focus should be on the template engine context.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1336 directly addresses the vulnerability within the Jinja template engine, while CWE-94 represents the broader category of code injection that results from this specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
