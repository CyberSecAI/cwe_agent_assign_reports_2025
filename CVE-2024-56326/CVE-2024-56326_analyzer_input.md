# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56326

## Vulnerability Description
Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An **oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format** allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinjas sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they dont escape the sandbox. However, its possible to store a reference to a malicious strings format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format**
- **product:** Jinja
- **impact:** execute arbitrary Python code, execute arbitrary Python code
- **attacker:** attacker
- **version:** prior to 3.1.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The Jinja sandboxed environment failed to properly handle indirect calls to the `str.format` method. While direct calls to `str.format` were caught by the sandbox, it was possible to store a reference to a malicious string's `format` method and then pass it to a filter that would call it, bypassing the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The sandbox did not fully sanitize or validate calls to `str.format` when invoked indirectly through a filter.
- **Indirect Call Bypass:** The sandbox's checks were not comprehensive enough to detect and prevent indirect calls to methods like `str.format` from being used maliciously.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who controls the content of a Jinja template can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.
- **Security Breach:** Exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application and the server hosting it.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Template Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious code into Jinja templates. This typically occurs when template content is dynamically constructed using user-supplied input.
- **Custom Filters:** Attackers can leverage custom filters within the application's Jinja environment that might not be designed with security in mind to execute the malicious `format` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Template Control:** The attacker must have control over the content of a Jinja template. This could be through an application that takes user input and uses it to render a template.
- **Custom Filter Access:**  The attacker would need to identify or create a scenario where a filter that accepts a callable argument is available and can then be used in conjunction with a stored reference to `str.format`

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix involves ensuring that the sandboxed environment intercepts indirect calls to `str.format`, preventing the malicious execution.
-   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability has a "Moderate" severity score of 5.4.
-   The CVSS v4 base metrics indicates the following:
    -   Attack Vector: Local
    -   Attack Complexity: Low
    -   Attack Requirements: Present
    -   Privileges Required: Low
    -   User Interaction: Passive
    -   Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact: High
    -   Subsequent System Impact: None

This vulnerability is related to the GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h advisory, which is a known security vulnerability in the Jinja2 templating engine.
