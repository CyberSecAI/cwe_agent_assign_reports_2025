  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KEYS trusted dcp fix leak of blob encryption key **Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load**, but keep the sealed payload in the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply convert this field to hex and send it to userspace. With DCP-based trusted keys, we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK) in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload. BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text. Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead of the encrypted BEK to userspace. This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases are to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key blob and then just use it without exporting it again. Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking the key via **uninitialized memory**.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the in-place decryption of the Blob Encryption Key (BEK) within the trusted key blob when using DCP-based trusted keys. After the BEK is decrypted, it remains in plaintext within the blob field. Subsequent reads (exports) of the key would then send the plaintext BEK to userspace instead of the encrypted version.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Plaintext Key Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the plaintext BEK after decryption in the kernel's memory. This decrypted key is then sent to userspace during export operations.\n- **In-place decryption:** The BEK is decrypted directly into the blob field, overwriting the encrypted data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Key Leakage:** An attacker could potentially obtain the plaintext BEK by exporting the key after it has been imported. This compromised key could then be used to decrypt other sensitive data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Import and Export:** The vulnerability is triggered by importing a trusted DCP-based key and then exporting it. This would leak the decrypted BEK.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to Import and Export Keys:** The attacker needs to be able to import a trusted DCP-based key into the kernel's keyring and then export it. This typically implies having some level of privilege on the system to interact with the kernel keyring.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is specific to NXP DCP-backed trusted keys.\n- The issue is present in Linux kernel versions v6.10 and later.\n- The fix involves performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated buffer, and clearing the plaintext BEK buffer to prevent leaks.\n- The issue occurs when exporting the trusted key after it has been imported and unsealed\n- Common use cases are either to create a new trusted key and export it or import a key blob and use it without exporting it, which means this issue is less likely to occur in common use cases",

CWE-321 is chosen because the vulnerability involves the exposure of a decrypted key, which can be seen as a hard-coded value after the decryption process. CWE-1394 is considered as a secondary candidate because the BEK is decrypted in place, the decrypted BEK can be considered as a default key, thus can be a candidate. Other candidates like CWE-532 and CWE-824 are also considered, but they are not direct fits for the root cause. The abstraction levels were considered, preferring the most specific level (Variant for CWE-321).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1394,cwe532,cwe824 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Trusted keys unsealing the key blob on load**, leading to the in-place decryption of the BEK. This results in the BEK being stored in plaintext, and subsequent reads leading to the **leak of the blob encryption key**. The final impact is the exposure of the plaintext BEK to userspace.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The key evidence is the **rootcause**, **uninitialized memory** after the decryption process and the **weakness** of **Trusted keys unsealing the key blob on load**. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were used to identify the most relevant CWEs. The relationships between CWEs, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-798 and CWE-321, were considered. Ultimately, CWE-321 was selected as the primary CWE due to its specific relevance to the vulnerability involving the exposure of a decrypted key. CWE-1394 was considered since the decrypted BEK can be considered as a default key. CWE-532 was considered since the decrypted BEK can be leaked via logs, and CWE-824 was considered due to the **uninitialized memory**. The confidence is rated as 0.8 due to the relatively clear description of the vulnerability and the availability of supporting evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve improper locking.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve unchecked return values.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: While there's a key involved, it's not about weak credentials being used initially, but about the exposure of the key after decryption.\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve improper validation of indices, positions, or offsets.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not the primary issue, although the exposure of the key is an observable discrepancy.
