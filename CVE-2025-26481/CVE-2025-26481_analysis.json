The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), a Class-level CWE. While there are no direct child CWEs that are immediately applicable based on the provided information, it's important to note that CWE-400 is a high-level category. The relationships show that CWE-400 can be caused by several other CWEs, but without further information, it is the most accurate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400)\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which directly leads to a denial-of-service condition. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this. The retriever results also list CWE-400 as the top candidate. The evidence is strong and directly supports the classification of CWE-400 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-834: Excessive Iteration:** While excessive iteration can lead to resource consumption, the description doesn't specify iteration as the cause.\n*   **CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime:** The description doesn't mention a missing resource release.\n*   **CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation:** The description doesn't mention inefficient computation.\n*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** This is closely related, but CWE-400 is a better fit since it's more general.\n*   **CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity:** This is not relevant to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value:** This is not directly indicated in the description.\n*   **CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool:** This could be related, but the primary issue is the uncontrolled consumption, not the size of the pool.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-400 is based on the evidence that the **uncontrolled resource consumption** is the **root cause** of the denial of service.",
