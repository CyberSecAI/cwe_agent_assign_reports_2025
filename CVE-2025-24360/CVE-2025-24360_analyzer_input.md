# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-24360

## Vulnerability Description
Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Starting in version 3.8.1 and prior to version 3.15.3, Nuxt allows any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to **default CORS settings**. Users with the default server.cors option using Vite builder may get the source code stolen by malicious websites. Version 3.15.3 fixes the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default CORS settings**
- **impact:** read response
- **product:** Nuxt
- **version:** 3.8.1 to 3.15.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-24360 - Nuxt allows any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Permissive default CORS settings (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).
*   Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.
*   Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests (mitigated by Chrome 94+ or HTTPS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration.
*   Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
*   DNS rebinding vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Source code theft by malicious websites.
*   Access to functionalities not intended for external exposure.
*   Potential exploitation of plugins sending messages over WebSocket.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Malicious website sending requests to the development server.
*   Exploiting WebSocket connections without Origin validation.
*   DNS rebinding attacks (for HTTP servers).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to serve a malicious web page.
*   User accessing the malicious web page.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to Nuxt version >=3.15.3.
*   For affected versions:
    *   Set `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.
    *   For backend integration, set `server.origin` and `server.cors.origin`.
    *   For reverse proxies, use `server.allowedHosts`.
    *   For accessing via a domain other than `localhost`, use `server.allowedHosts`.
    *   For plugins connecting to WebSocket, upgrade the plugin or set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` (with security implications).
*   Use HTTPS for the development server.
