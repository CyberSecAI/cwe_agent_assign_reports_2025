  "description": "Entrust Instant Financial Issuance (formerly known as Cardwizard) 6.10.0, 6.9.0, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, and 6.8.x and earlier uses a DLL library (i.e. DCG.Security.dll) with a custom AES encryption process that relies on static hard-coded key values. These keys are not uniquely generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can be obtained from WebAPI.cfg.xml in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead to privilege escalation on the Windows host.",

This is a variant of **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the custom AES encryption uses static, hard-coded key values, which is the root cause. This leads to the ability to decrypt sensitive information and escalate privileges.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe259 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321)**. An attacker can obtain the encrypted password from the `WebAPI.cfg.xml` file (related to CVE-2024-39341). Using the **hard-coded key**, the attacker can decrypt the password, leading to **privilege escalation** on the Windows host.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of static hard-coded key values** within the custom AES encryption process. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the use of a static hard-coded key as the root cause. The impact is privilege escalation, but the root cause is the insecure key management. The retriever results also support **CWE-321** as the top candidate.\n\n**CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** is considered as a secondary CWE, as **CWE-321** is a child of **CWE-798** and more specific.\n\n**CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** is a peer of **CWE-321**, but since this vulnerability involves a cryptographic key rather than a password, **CWE-321** is more appropriate.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-321** is based on the evidence that a cryptographic key is hard-coded and used in a custom encryption process. This is more specific than just using any hard-coded credential.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While the hard-coded key can be considered a weak credential, **CWE-1391** is too broad and is a Class level.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
