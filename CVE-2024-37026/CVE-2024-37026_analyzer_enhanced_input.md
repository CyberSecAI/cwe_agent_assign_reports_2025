### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **The GuC context scheduling queue is 2 entires deep, thus it is possible for a migration job to be stuck behind a fault if migration exec queue shares engines with user jobs**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/xe

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GuC (Graphics micro-controller) context scheduling queue has a limited depth of 2 entries. When the migration exec queue shares engines with user jobs, a migration job can get stuck behind a faulting user job. This occurs because the migrate exec queue is needed to service page faults, but if it's blocked, it can lead to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Resource contention:** The migration execution queue shares resources (BCS engines) with user-level jobs.
- **Limited queue depth:** The GuC context scheduling queue's shallow depth of 2 exacerbates the contention issue.
- **Dependency on migration for fault handling:** The migration exec queue is required to service page faults.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** A deadlock can occur when a migration job gets stuck behind a faulting job, preventing the system from servicing page faults and thus halting progress.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of events involving user-level jobs causing page faults and migration jobs attempting to execute. It does not appear to be directly exploitable by an attacker, but occurs because of the way the system is designed.
- It's more of a design flaw than a directly exploitable vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by normal user space activity. No special privileges or capabilities are needed to trigger this deadlock.

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.

- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.




## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field




## CWE-833: Deadlock

- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock
- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions




## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

### Extended Description


While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

- **CVE-2019-20176:** Product allocates a new buffer on the stack for each file in a directory, allowing stack exhaustion
- **CVE-2013-1591:** Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection




## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.

### Extended Description


A resource injection issue occurs when the following two conditions are met:


  1. An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource. For example, an attacker might be able to specify part of the name of a file to be opened or a port number to be used.

  1. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted. For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file, run with a configuration controlled by the attacker, or transmit sensitive information to a third-party server.

This may enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.

### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference: OWASP uses this term, although it is effectively the same as resource injection.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
PeerOf -> CWE-706
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-73

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation (CWE-73).

**[Maintenance]** The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 "Resource Injection," as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the "identifier used to access a system resource" such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the "resource injection" term does not apply to "path manipulation," which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2013-4787:** chain: mobile OS verifies cryptographic signature of file in an archive, but then installs a different file with the same name that is also listed in the archive.
