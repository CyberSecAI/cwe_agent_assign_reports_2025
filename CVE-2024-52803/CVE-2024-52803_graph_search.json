This vulnerability arises from improper handling of user input, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary OS commands on the host system. The issue is caused by insecure usage of the `Popen` function with `shell=True`, coupled with unsanitized user input. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate the risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-138 CWE-20 CWE-95 CWE-77 CWE-250 CWE-90 CWE-88 CWE-1427 CWE-78",
