This suggests a potential issue with input validation or handling of edge cases within the LSTM cell implementation.\n* **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a crash of the program, leading to denial of service.\n* **Attack vectors:** Providing specifically crafted input tensors (empty tensors with specific weight values) to the `torch.lstm_cell` function.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `torch.lstm_cell` function, meaning they need to be able to influence the PyTorch code being executed.\n* **Mitigation or fix:**  The content does not provide a mitigation or fix, only a report of the issue.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would initially. It includes a minimal reproducible example, the specific PyTorch version affected (2.6.0), and labels indicating the issue has been triaged. The issue was discovered through fuzzing.",
