It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document doesn\\'t specify the exact root cause within the plugin\\'s code, only that it *is* vulnerable to CSRF.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. This involves tricking an authenticated user into executing an unwanted action on the vulnerable application.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that the authenticated user will execute.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 13, 2025).\\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Software:** Page/Post Specific Social Share Buttons WordPress Plugin\\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 2.1\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\\n*   **PSID:** 4ec70b4cd30e', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:CompleteWebResources Page/Post Specific Social Share Buttons', 'keyphrase': 'CompleteWebResources Page/Post Specific Social Share Buttons', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(336.89761884573494)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
