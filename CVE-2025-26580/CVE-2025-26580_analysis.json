It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document doesn't specify the exact root cause within the plugin's code, only that it *is* vulnerable to CSRF.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. This involves tricking an authenticated user into executing an unwanted action on the vulnerable application.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that the authenticated user will execute.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 13, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Page/Post Specific Social Share Buttons WordPress Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 2.1\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **PSID:** 4ec70b4cd30e",

The description explicitly states both vulnerabilities, making it clear that the application is susceptible to both.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe80\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe80 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, which allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions they did not intend. The impact of this is that it allows the attacker to inject a **Stored XSS**, i.e. **CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, which is then executed by other users who view the affected page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states both **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.\n\nThe key evidence lies in the vulnerability description: \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in CompleteWebResources Page/Post Specific Social Share Buttons allows Stored **XSS**.\"\n\n*   **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is selected because the application does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user.\n*   **CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** is selected because the application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the specific weaknesses present in the application.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
