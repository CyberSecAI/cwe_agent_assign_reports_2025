## Vulnerability Description
The Intelligence plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due the plugin not preventing direct access to the /vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php file and display_errors being enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **vector:** direct access to /vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php file
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** WordPress Intelligence plugin
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.4.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the Intelligence plugin not preventing direct access to the `/vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php` file and the `display_errors` setting being enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated full path disclosure vulnerability.
- Insecure direct object reference due to lack of access control on the `index.php` file.
- Enabled `display_errors` setting which leaks sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of the full path of the web application.
- This information can be used to aid other attacks, but by itself is not useful without other existing vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attacker directly accesses `/vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and have knowledge of the vulnerable file location.
