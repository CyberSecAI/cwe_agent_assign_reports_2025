The retriever results also suggested CWE-306 and CWE-862. CWE-306 and CWE-862 are related to authentication and authorization, respectively. The vulnerability description mentions unauthenticated attackers, which makes these CWEs plausible. However, the **sensitive information exposure** occurs through a publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script, making the lack of access control the more direct cause, although it is not explicit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n\n    cwe532 -- CHILDOF --> cwe200\n    cwe538 -- CHILDOF --> cwe200\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe425 -- CHILDOF --> cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script. Because the script is publicly accessible, unauthenticated attackers can view potentially **sensitive information**.\n\nVulnerability Chain:\n1.  Publicly Accessible `phpinfo.php` script\n2.  **Sensitive Information Exposure**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Sensitive Information Exposure** as the primary **weakness**. The vulnerability occurs because of a publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script. This allows unauthenticated attackers to view potentially **sensitive information**.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-200, CWE-306, and CWE-862. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a class-level CWE that broadly describes the vulnerability. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) are related to authentication and authorization, which are plausible given that the attackers are unauthenticated.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-200 as the primary CWE, because the direct cause is the exposure itself, and not necessarily a **missing authentication** or **authorization**. Though **missing authentication** or **authorization** could be the root cause, the description does not provide enough detail to confirm. The evidence for this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view potentially **sensitive information** contained in the exposed file.\"\n\nCWE-200 is chosen despite it being a class level CWE and discouraged. Without more information, this is the best fit.",
