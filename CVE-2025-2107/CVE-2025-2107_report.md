# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-2107

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-2107

## Description

The ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the id parameter of the printResultAndDie() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This only appears to be exploitable on very old versions of WordPress.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** ['extract sensitive information from the database', 'append additional SQL queries']
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.0.8
- **Component:** id parameter of the printResultAndDie() function

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
2.  **Weakness:** SQL Injection
3.  **Impact:** Extraction of sensitive information from the database, and the ability to append additional SQL queries.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-89, which directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection. The vulnerability description clearly states that the ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to "**insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**." The evidence directly supports this classification. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.

The other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results, such as CWE-116, CWE-90, CWE-502, CWE-352, CWE-790, CWE-138, CWE-862, CWE-79, and CWE-184, were considered, but they do not precisely describe the root cause of the vulnerability. For instance, CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is too general, while CWE-90 (LDAP Injection) and CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) point to different attack vectors.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the SQL injection vulnerability caused by the improper handling of special elements in SQL commands.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Used:* Not relevant as the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Used:* While encoding issues can contribute, the description specifies **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which points more directly to SQL injection.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* Not relevant as the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* Not relevant as the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* Not relevant as the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
