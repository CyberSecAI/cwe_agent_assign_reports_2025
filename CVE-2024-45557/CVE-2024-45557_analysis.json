It is related to CWE-119, a Class level CWE, through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-1285, also a Base level CWE, can precede CWE-119. The relationship analysis shows that improper input validation (CWE-20/CWE-1285) could lead to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) via improper restriction of operations (CWE-119). The abstraction levels influenced the decision, favoring the more specific Base level CWEs (CWE-787 and CWE-1285).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1285 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1285,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **TME processes addresses from TZ and MPSS requests without proper validation**. This **improper validation** (CWE-20/CWE-1285) leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787).\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Validation** (CWE-20/CWE-1285)\n  - Weakness: **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) leading to **Memory Corruption**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the description of memory corruption due to processing addresses without proper validation. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights the **rootcause** as \"**TME processes addresses from TZ and MPSS requests without proper validation**\" and the **weakness** as \"**Memory corruption**.\" The retriever results also rank CWE-787 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) were considered as contributing factors, since the vulnerability stems from **lack of proper validation**. CWE-1285 is more specific than CWE-20, but both are possible given that the description refers to addresses.\n\nThe graph relationships further support this analysis, showing that **improper validation** can lead to memory corruption. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 representing the direct **memory corruption** and CWE-1285 representing the underlying **improper validation** of addresses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of
