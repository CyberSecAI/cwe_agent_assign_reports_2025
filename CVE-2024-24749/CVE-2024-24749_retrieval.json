  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-24749', description='GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3, if GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server, it is possible to **bypass existing input validation** in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources with specific file name extensions. If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the **default password**) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server. One may also disable anonymous access to the embeded GeoWebCache administration and status pages.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['bypass existing input validation', 'default password'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': ['gain administrator privileges', 'read arbitrary classpath resources'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'GeoServer', 'version': 'prior to 2.23.5 and 2.24.3', 'component': 'GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24749\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `ByteStreamController` class of GeoWebCache (GWC) when deployed on a Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server.\\n- Specifically, the `ByteStreamController` failed to properly sanitize the URL path, allowing for the use of backslash characters (`\\\\`) to traverse directories.\\n- Additionally, double decoding of the URL path could be exploited to bypass existing URL checks, allowing access to arbitrary classpath resources.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).  By manipulating the URL path with backslashes (`\\\\`), an attacker can access files and directories outside of the intended web root.\\n- **Double URL Decoding:** The vulnerability also involves a double decoding issue, where the URL is decoded twice, allowing attackers to bypass URL checks designed to prevent access to certain resources.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary Classpath Resource Access:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary classpath resources by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability. This includes configuration files, libraries, and other sensitive data within the server\\'s classpath.\\n- **Privilege Escalation (Conditional):** If GeoServer is deployed using the embedded data directory within the `geoserver.war` file, it may be possible for an attacker to read specific resources that could be used to gain administrative privileges. However, this is considered unlikely in production environments, as it is recommended to use an external data directory to persist configurations.\\n- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to access files they shouldn\\'t have access to, leading to information disclosure.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.\\n- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/rest/web/` endpoint with malicious path parameters.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the GeoServer instance running GeoWebCache.\\n- No special privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N).\\n- The attacker needs to be aware of the path structure on the server to craft the specific requests, and be aware that this vulnerability is only exploitable on windows servers with tomcat.\\n- The attack complexity is rated as high (AC:H), likely meaning that some knowledge of the target system and its deployment is necessary.\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n- The vulnerability was patched by improving input validation in `ByteStreamController` to prevent the use of backslashes and to avoid double decoding.\\n- The recommended fix is to update to GeoServer version 2.23.5 or 2.24.3, which include the patch from [GeoWebCache/geowebcache#1211](https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/pull/1211)\\n- Disabling anonymous access to GWC web resources is also suggested as a workaround for environments where an upgrade is not possible. This prevents unauthenticated users from accessing the vulnerable endpoint.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n- The vulnerability is specific to Windows environments using Apache Tomcat.\\n- Linux and macOS are not considered vulnerable, and other application servers like Jetty and WildFly are confirmed to not be vulnerable.\\n- The CVSS score of 5.9 is rated as \"Moderate\" severity.',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3, if GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server, it is possible to **bypass existing input validation** in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources with specific file name extensions. If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the **default password**) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server. One may also disable anonymous access to the embeded GeoWebCache administration and status pages.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'bypass existing input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
