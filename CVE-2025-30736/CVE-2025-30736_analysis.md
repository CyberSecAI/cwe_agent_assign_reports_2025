# Analysis for CVE-2025-30736

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.4 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, indicating a **missing authentication** issue. CWE-306 is a base-level CWE and does not have a parent-child relationship with any of the other high scoring CWEs. CWE-200 is a Class level CWE, and is too general, however it is included since the impact of the missing authentication is exposure of sensitive information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access. This leads to unauthorized creation, deletion, or modification of critical data, as well as unauthorized access to sensitive information, which aligns with the impact described in CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus is on the **missing authentication** (**ROOTCAUSE**) aspect, making CWE-306 the most suitable primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that an "unauthenticated attacker" can compromise the Java VM. This points directly to a **lack of authentication** for a critical function. The retriever results also list CWE-306 as a candidate, although not the highest ranked.

CWE-200 is considered a secondary CWE because the **impact** of the missing authentication is the unauthorized access to and modification of sensitive data. However, as noted in the description for CWE-200, it is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.

The selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 586.66
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 553.00
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended
