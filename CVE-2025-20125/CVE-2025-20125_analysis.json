  "description": "A vulnerability in an API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with valid read-only credentials to obtain sensitive information, change node configurations, and restart the node. This vulnerability is due to a **lack of authorization in a specific API and improper validation of user-supplied data**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a specific API on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to attacker to obtain information, modify system configuration, and reload the device. Note&nbspTo successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid read-only administrative credentials. In a single-node deployment, new devices will not be able to authenticate during the reload time.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states, \"This vulnerability is due to a **lack of authorization** in a specific API and **improper validation** of user-supplied data.\" This directly supports the selection of **CWE-862**. The secondary weakness is **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** because the **improper validation** of user-supplied data contributed to the vulnerability.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by illustrating how the lack of authorization (**CWE-862**) is the primary weakness, allowing the subsequent **improper validation** (**CWE-20**) to be exploited.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-862** is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root causes. **CWE-20** is a Class level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Though information exposure is an impact, the root cause is not related to **exposure** but **lack of authorization** and **improper validation**.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
