  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function AssimpSceneCombinerAddNodeHashes of the file code/Common/SceneCombiner.cpp of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is identified as a0993658f40d8e13ff5823990c30b43c82a5daf0. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
