While CWE-119 describes a general class of memory buffer errors, CWE-787 pinpoints the specific error of writing beyond the buffer's boundaries. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also strongly suggest CWE-787 as the primary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **memory safety bugs** which lead to **memory corruption**. The specific type of memory corruption is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-787 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's mention of **memory corruption** and the possibility of arbitrary code execution. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions reinforce this selection. The vulnerability description key phrases also point to **memory safety bugs**.\n\nThe evidence provided, while not extremely detailed, is sufficient to identify the presence of a **memory corruption** issue, specifically an out-of-bounds write. The selection of CWE-787 is based on its specificity and alignment with the vulnerability's root cause and potential impact.

While CWE-119 describes a general class of memory buffer errors, CWE-787 pinpoints the specific error of writing beyond the buffer's boundaries. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also strongly suggest CWE-787 as the primary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **memory safety bugs** which lead to **memory corruption**.
