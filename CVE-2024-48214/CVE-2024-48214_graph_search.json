This vulnerability allows an attacker to create a custom, unauthenticated QR code and abuse one of the parameters, either SSID or PASSWORD, in the JSON data contained within the QR code. By that, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the camera. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-138 CWE-121 CWE-1188 CWE-77 CWE-94 CWE-259 CWE-88 CWE-790 CWE-78",
