  "query": "KERUI HD 3MP 1080P Tuya Camera 1.0.4 has a command injection vulnerability in the module that connects to the local network via a QR code. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create a custom, unauthenticated QR code and abuse one of the parameters, either SSID or PASSWORD, in the JSON data contained within the QR code. By that, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the camera.",
