# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12558

## Vulnerability Description
The WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the export_db function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information from the database, such as the hashed administrator password.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Relevant Content:
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12558.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on the `export_db` function within the WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin. This allows authenticated users (Subscriber level and above) to execute the function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper authorization check on the `export_db` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with minimal privileges (Subscriber role), to trigger the function.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `export_db` function can be used to export sensitive information directly from the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to extract potentially sensitive information from the database, including hashed administrator passwords. This could lead to:
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use the leaked administrator password hashes to gain complete control of the WordPress site.
- **Data Breach:**  Exposing other database information can lead to further privacy violations and potentially financial loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `app_export_db` AJAX action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. This means the attacker needs at least a subscriber-level account.
- The attacker does not require any specific position in the network as they are using the website itself.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.9.2.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.0.0 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to expose sensitive information from the database such as the hashed admin password.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by accessing the `wp_ajax_app_export_db` AJAX action without sufficient authorization.
- The export functionality of this plugin generates a SQL file of the database records, which when exported without authentication, exposes sensitive data
-The fix was implemented by adding nonce verification and privilege checks to the export functions.
