This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information from the database, such as the hashed administrator password.",

  "reference_content": "### Relevant Content:\nThe provided content relates to CVE-2024-12558.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on the `export_db` function within the WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin. This allows authenticated users (Subscriber level and above) to execute the function.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper authorization check on the `export_db` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with minimal privileges (Subscriber role), to trigger the function.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `export_db` function can be used to export sensitive information directly from the database.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to extract potentially sensitive information from the database, including hashed administrator passwords. This could lead to:\n- **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use the leaked administrator password hashes to gain complete control of the WordPress site.\n- **Data Breach:**  Exposing other database information can lead to further privacy violations and potentially financial loss.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the `app_export_db` AJAX action.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n-   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. This means the attacker needs at least a subscriber-level account.\n- The attacker does not require any specific position in the network as they are using the website itself.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.9.2.\n- The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.0.0 of the plugin.\n- The vulnerability allows an attacker to expose sensitive information from the database such as the hashed admin password.\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by accessing the `wp_ajax_app_export_db` AJAX action without sufficient authorization.\n- The export functionality of this plugin generates a SQL file of the database records, which when exported without authentication, exposes sensitive data\n-The fix was implemented by adding nonce verification and privilege checks to the export functions.",

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control.
