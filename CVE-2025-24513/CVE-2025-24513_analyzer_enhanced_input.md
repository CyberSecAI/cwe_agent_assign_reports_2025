## Vulnerability Description
A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx https//github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx where attacker-provided data are included in a filename by the ingress-nginx Admission Controller feature, resulting in directory traversal within the container. This could result in denial of service, or when combined with other vulnerabilities, limited disclosure of Secret objects from the cluster.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** Admission Controller feature
- **weakness:** **directory traversal, inclusion of attacker-provided data in filename**
- **product:** ingress-nginx
- **impact:** denial of service, limited disclosure of Secret objects

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-24513 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-24513. It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Attacker-provided data is included in a filename by the ingress-nginx Admission Controller feature, resulting in directory traversal within the container.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Directory traversal vulnerability
*   Improper input sanitization in the ingress-nginx Admission Controller.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service
*   Limited disclosure of Secret objects from the cluster (when combined with other vulnerabilities).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploitation through attacker-controlled data provided to the ingress-nginx Admission Controller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker with the ability to provide data that is processed by the ingress-nginx Admission Controller. No authentication is required (PR:N).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.
