One method involves including random data in the HTTP request body with a HTTP GET method. Another is insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing special characters.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n*   Filter bypass: allows malicious inputs to reach the underlying web application.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n*   An attacker can bypass the WAF, allowing malicious inputs to reach the underlying web application.\n\nAttack vectors:\n*   Crafted HTTP requests with random data in the body and a GET method.\n*   Adding special characters to the request.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n*   The vulnerabilities appear to be fixed. Radware acknowledged the vulnerability, fixed the issue, and published a technical knowledge base article.\n```",

CWE-444 and CWE-113 are considered secondary candidates because they address HTTP request inconsistencies and CRLF injection, respectively, but are less directly related to the core weakness of trusting potentially malicious inputs.

This **reliance on untrusted input** (CWE-807) allows attackers to bypass the WAF by including random data in the request body when using the GET method. This bypass leads to malicious inputs reaching the underlying web application, which could result in various impacts depending on the application's vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, including CWE-113, CWE-444, and CWE-807. The final decision favors CWE-807 because it directly addresses the **root cause of the vulnerability: the WAF's reliance on untrusted inputs**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the WAF can be bypassed by placing random data in the HTTP request body. This indicates that the WAF is not properly validating the request body, which is a form of **relying on untrusted input** for security decisions.\n\nThe selection of CWE-807 is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states that the vulnerability involves filter bypass via specially crafted HTTP requests. The retriever results also list CWE-807 as a relevant candidate, although its score is not the highest.\n\nCWE-444 and CWE-113 are considered secondary candidates as they relate to HTTP request inconsistencies and CRLF injection, respectively, but are not the primary weakness. CWE-807, being a Base-level CWE, provides the appropriate level of specificity for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
