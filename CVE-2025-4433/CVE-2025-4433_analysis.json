CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and is more specific. Several peer relationships exist between authorization-related CWEs (e.g., CWE-862, CWE-285).

The guidance on authentication vs. authorization helped to narrow down the selection to authorization-related CWEs.\n\nThe primary selection of CWE-863 is based on the vulnerability description indicating an **improper access control**, specifically that a non-admin user is able to add users to admin groups. This suggests the presence of an authorization check that is not functioning correctly. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 as the top candidate.\n\nThe secondary candidates like CWE-266, CWE-269, and CWE-285 are also considered. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) could be a contributing factor, as the group to which the user is being added has incorrect privileges. CWE-269 and CWE-285, although related, are less specific than CWE-863 in this context.\n\nThe final decision is to primarily map to CWE-863, as it best captures the **incorrect authorization** mechanism that allows privilege escalation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n    *   **Description**: The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n    *   The vulnerability description explicitly states **\"Improper access control\"** which aligns with the description of CWE-863 which means the authorization check exists but is flawed.\n*   **CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment**\n    *   **Description**: A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n    *   A non-administrative user with both User Management and User Group Management permissions to perform privilege escalation by adding users to groups with administrative privileges.\n    *   This is not the root cause but can be a contributing factor.\n*   **CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management**\n    *   **Description**: The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n    *   This is a higher level CWE than CWE-863.\n*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n    *   **Description**: The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n    *   This is a higher level CWE than CWE-863.\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\nCWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\nCWE-285: Improper Authorization\nCWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\nCWE-286: Incorrect User Management\nCWE-284: Improper Access Control\nCWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\nCWE-862: Missing Authorization\nCWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\nCWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\nCWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges",
