# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-0191

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0191

## Description

A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file upload feature of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt version 20240914. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request
- **Impact:** Denial of Service
- **Vector:** sending a payload with an excessively large filename
- **Product:** gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt
- **Version:** 20240914
- **Component:** file upload feature

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The root cause is the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** when handling large filenames. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The **improper handling** leads to excessive resource consumption, causing a DoS. |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While a file is being uploaded, the weakness is not inherent to the file type itself, but the size. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which is a base-level CWE. CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-770. The relationship shows that the **uncontrolled allocation** (CWE-770) leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400).

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. This leads to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770). The **uncontrolled allocation** results in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), ultimately causing a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**, which leads to excessive resource allocation without limits. The evidence supports mapping this vulnerability to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) because the system **allocates resources** based on the filename size, and there is **no limit or throttling** mechanism in place. The **uncontrolled allocation** leads directly to a denial-of-service condition.

The vulnerability description states: "The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users."

The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) further supports this analysis. CWE-400 represents the impact of the **uncontrolled resource allocation**, while CWE-770 represents the root cause.

CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was considered because the vulnerability involves a file upload feature, but the **root cause** is not related to the file type but rather the size of the filename.

Based on the evidence and relationship analysis, CWE-770 is the most appropriate primary CWE at the base level of abstraction.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
