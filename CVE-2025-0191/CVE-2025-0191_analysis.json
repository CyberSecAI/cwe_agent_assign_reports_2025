The root cause is the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** when handling large filenames. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The **improper handling** leads to excessive resource consumption, causing a DoS. |\n| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While a file is being uploaded, the weakness is not inherent to the file type itself, but the size. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which is a base-level CWE. CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-770. The relationship shows that the **uncontrolled allocation** (CWE-770) leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe434 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. This leads to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770). The **uncontrolled allocation** results in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), ultimately causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**, which leads to excessive resource allocation without limits. The evidence supports mapping this vulnerability to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) because the system **allocates resources** based on the filename size, and there is **no limit or throttling** mechanism in place. The **uncontrolled allocation** leads directly to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users.\"\n\nThe relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) further supports this analysis. CWE-400 represents the impact of the **uncontrolled resource allocation**, while CWE-770 represents the root cause.\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was considered because the vulnerability involves a file upload feature, but the **root cause** is not related to the file type but rather the size of the filename.\n\nBased on the evidence and relationship analysis, CWE-770 is the most appropriate primary CWE at the base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant
