The lack of integrity checks makes the messages malleable.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the messages can modify them, compromising data integrity.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with adjacent access to the vulnerable device and the ability to intercept and modify messages.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify messages within the goTenna network and have the ability to perform adjacent network attacks. Additionally, the attacker must have knowledge of the encryption mechanism (AES CTR).",
