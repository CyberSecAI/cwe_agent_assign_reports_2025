# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-43108

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-43108
## Query
The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin uses AES CTR type encryption for short, encrypted messages without any additional integrity checking mechanisms. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message. It is advised to continue to use encryption in the plugin and update to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lack of message integrity checking'
