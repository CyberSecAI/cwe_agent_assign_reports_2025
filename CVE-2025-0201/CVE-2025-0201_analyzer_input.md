## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `update_account.php` file of the "pos-inventory-system-in-php" project. The application directly uses the user-provided `username` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `username` parameter of the `update_account.php` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query through the `username` parameter.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information from the database.
- In the provided PoC, the attacker bypasses authentication by injecting `' or 1=1--` into the username field and changing the password, effectively hijacking the targeted user account.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `update_account.php`
- Exploitation through the `username` parameter in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable file (`update_account.php`) and the name of the vulnerable parameter (`username`).
- No user authentication is required for successful exploitation in the provided PoC.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability. It shows a crafted POST request that, when sent to the vulnerable server, will bypass authentication by injecting SQL code into the username field and changing user password.
