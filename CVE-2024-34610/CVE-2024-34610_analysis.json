While it is discouraged, the provided information does not give enough details to determine whether the issue lies specifically in authentication (CWE-306) or authorization (CWE-862). Therefore, CWE-284 serves as the best initial mapping.\n\nCWE-862 and CWE-306 are both children of CWE-284. If more details were available (e.g., no authentication required for a critical function or a missing authorization check after authentication), then one of those would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** which leads to local attackers being able to access protected data.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper access control**\n  - Impact: Access to protected data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper access control** as the root cause, which led to the selection of CWE-284. The guidance clearly states that if the root cause can be pinpointed to authentication or authorization, then a more specific CWE should be chosen, but given the lack of detail, CWE-284 is the most appropriate. Further investigation is needed to understand whether the **improper access control** is due to a lack of authentication (CWE-306) or a lack of authorization (CWE-862), or both.\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.
