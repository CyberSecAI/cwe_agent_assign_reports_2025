Therefore, CWE-190 *CanPrecede* CWE-787. Both are base level CWEs. CWE-190 is the root cause, while CWE-787 is the resulting vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Integer Overflow (CWE-190)**, which then results in an **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**.\n- The **Integer Overflow** is the root cause, as stated in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n- The **Out-of-bounds Write** is the impact of the overflow.\n- There are no missing links in the chain, as the overflow directly causes the out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis clearly points to an integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write. The evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**Integer overflow**\" and \"write out-of-bounds memory\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root cause** as an integer overflow in the `libSEF.quram.so` library, leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the direct progression from the root cause (CWE-190) to the resulting vulnerability (CWE-787). Both CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-190 and CWE-787 allows for their usage.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly represent the **root cause** and the resulting vulnerability described in the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
