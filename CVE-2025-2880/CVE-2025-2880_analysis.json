While it's generally better to choose Base or Variant level CWEs, in this case, the description directly states **\"Sensitive Information Exposure\"** which aligns well with CWE-200. Further specificity could be achieved by considering child CWEs of CWE-200, but the provided information does not allow for a confident selection of a more specific CWE. The related CWEs, like CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] and CWE-538 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory], were considered as they represent more specific cases of information exposure but weren't selected as primary due to lacking specific evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe538 secondary\n    class cwe532 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Sensitive Information Exposure** due to the misconfiguration.\n3.  **Impact:** Information Disclosure.\n\nThe chain highlights the direct exposure of sensitive information without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the explicit mention of **\"Sensitive Information Exposure\"** in the vulnerability description, which strongly aligns with CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]. The publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script enables unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive information.\n\nWhile CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, the provided information doesn't give enough specificity to confidently select a more detailed Base or Variant CWE. For instance, CWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File] could be applicable if the `phpinfo.php` was inadvertently writing information to a log file, but this isn't stated. Similarly, CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] could be considered if the exposed information was system-specific. CWE-538 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory] is also a good fit because the file is externally accessible.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is further supported by its high ranking in the Retriever Results. Although the mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 as a catch-all, in this case, the description directly indicates the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]: While authentication is missing, the primary issue is the exposure of sensitive data, not the missing authentication itself.\n*   CWE-668 [Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere]: This is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the specific weakness.\n*   CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]: This is not about *sending* data, but rather exposing it via a publicly accessible file.\n*   CWE-73 [External Control of File Name or Path]: Not applicable as there's no external control over file names or paths mentioned.",
