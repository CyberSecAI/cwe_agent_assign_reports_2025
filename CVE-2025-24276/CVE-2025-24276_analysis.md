# Analysis for CVE-2025-24276

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-277 | Insecure Inherited Permissions | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship. The retriever results suggested several Class-level CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, given the limited information and the nature of the vulnerability (**access private information** by a **malicious app**), CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions) a Variant of Improper Permissions, was selected as the closest match. CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) was considered as a secondary candidate due to the **impact** of accessing private information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is relatively simple:

1.  **Root Cause:** Insecure Inherited Permissions (CWE-277)
2.  **Impact:** A malicious app can access private information.

The missing link here is the technical mechanism by which the malicious app exploits the insecure permissions to access the information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is heavily based on the limited evidence provided, mainly the impact statement: "A malicious app may be able to access private information." The choice of CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions) is driven by the scenario of a malicious app gaining unauthorized access, suggesting an issue with how permissions are defined and inherited. The "addressed by removing the vulnerable code" suggests a more specific vulnerability related to permissions rather than broad input validation or memory safety issues.

CWEs considered but not selected:

*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): Although a top result, it doesn't align with the **impact** of accessing private information or the mitigation of removing vulnerable code.
*   CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')): Also doesn't fit the **impact** description.
*   CWE-665 (Improper Initialization): The mitigation doesn't really match this CWE.
*   CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere): While relevant to the **impact**, it's more of a consequence than the root cause.
*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) & CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): These are more general than CWE-277.

The selection is at the Variant level (CWE-277), which is more specific than the Class level authorization CWEs considered.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
