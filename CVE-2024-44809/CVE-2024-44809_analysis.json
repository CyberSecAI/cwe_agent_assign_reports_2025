  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-44809",
  "description": "A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the Pi Camera project, version 1.0, maintained by RECANTHA. The issue arises from **improper sanitization of user input** passed to the position GET parameter in the tilt.php script. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted input data that includes malicious command sequences, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and poses significant risk if the application is exposed to untrusted networks.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-44809:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `position` GET parameter in the `tilt.php` script of the Raspberry Pi Camera project.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating the `position` parameter.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `tilt.php` script fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious command sequences to be injected.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any shell command on the server, under the privileges of the web server user (e.g., \"pi\" or \"root\").\n- **Complete System Compromise:** This could lead to a full compromise of the Raspberry Pi device, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Remote:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `tilt.php` script, specifically manipulating the `position` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable application.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover the location of the `tilt.php` script.\n- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding how to craft a GET request and manipulate URL parameters is sufficient for exploitation.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The vulnerability is present in a learning tool designed for beginners who are unlikely to have the knowledge to detect or mitigate such risks.\n- A Proof of Concept is provided: `[http://host.com/?position=;whoami](http://host.com/?position=%3Bwhoami)`  The `;whoami` command shows the user running the web server, and any other shell command can also be executed.\n- Remediation includes: input validation and regular code audits.",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **improper sanitization of user input** passed to the `position` GET parameter, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-78, which focuses on the **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the `tilt.php` script fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious command sequences to be injected.\n\nThe choice of CWE-78 is further supported by the Retriever Results, which lists CWE-78 as a relevant weakness with a score of 0.556. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is also listed, it is a more general weakness. Given that the vulnerability description specifies that the **improper sanitization** directly leads to OS command injection, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe CWE selection is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, aligning with the principle of evidence-based decision-making. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and its parent CWEs (CWE-77 and CWE-74) was also considered.\n\nCWE-20 was considered as a contributing factor since the **improper sanitization of user input** could also be seen as a lack of input validation. However, CWE-78 is a more precise description of the vulnerability since it directly causes OS command injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:**\n    *   **rootcause:** **improper sanitization of user input**\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:**\n    *   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `position` GET parameter in the `tilt.php` script of the Raspberry Pi Camera project.\n    *   The `tilt.php` script fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious command sequences to be injected.\n\nTherefore, CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, and is supported by evidence and mapping guidance.",
