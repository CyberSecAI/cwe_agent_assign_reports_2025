# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44809

## Vulnerability Description
A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the Pi Camera project, version 1.0, maintained by RECANTHA. The issue arises from **improper sanitization of user input** passed to the position GET parameter in the tilt.php script. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted input data that includes malicious command sequences, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and poses significant risk if the application is exposed to untrusted networks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper sanitization of user input**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **vector:** crafted input data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Pi Camera project
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** tilt.php script

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-44809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `position` GET parameter in the `tilt.php` script of the Raspberry Pi Camera project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating the `position` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `tilt.php` script fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious command sequences to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any shell command on the server, under the privileges of the web server user (e.g., "pi" or "root").
- **Complete System Compromise:** This could lead to a full compromise of the Raspberry Pi device, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `tilt.php` script, specifically manipulating the `position` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover the location of the `tilt.php` script.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding how to craft a GET request and manipulate URL parameters is sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in a learning tool designed for beginners who are unlikely to have the knowledge to detect or mitigate such risks.
- A Proof of Concept is provided: `[http://host.com/?position=;whoami](http://host.com/?position=%3Bwhoami)`  The `;whoami` command shows the user running the web server, and any other shell command can also be executed.
- Remediation includes: input validation and regular code audits.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
