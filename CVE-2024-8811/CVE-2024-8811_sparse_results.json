  "query": "WinZip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archive files. When opening an archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip removes the Mark-of-the-Web from the archive file. Following extraction, the extracted files also lack the Mark-of-the-Web. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23983.",
