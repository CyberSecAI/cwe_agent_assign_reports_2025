# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-31152

## Vulnerability Description
The LevelOne WBR-6012 router with firmware R0.40e6 is vulnerable to **improper resource allocation** within its web application, where a series of crafted HTTP requests can cause a reboot. This could lead to network service interruptions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper resource allocation**
- **impact:** reboot
- **vector:** crafted HTTP requests
- **product:** LevelOne WBR-6012 router
- **version:** firmware R0.40e6
- **component:** web application

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The LevelOne WBR-6012 router's web application lacks sufficient rate-limiting measures. This allows an attacker to send a large number of requests which the device cannot handle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Resource Allocation:** The web application is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption due to the absence of proper rate-limiting.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows for a flood-based DoS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Disruption:** Exploiting the vulnerability causes the router to crash and reboot, leading to network service interruptions.
*  Potential **backdoor access**: The crash may enable backdoor access (related to TALOS-2024-1979)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending HTTP POST requests over the network.
*   **Specifically:** the attacker sends a flood of valid HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/logi` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same network as the device, unless the web interface is exposed to the internet.
*   **No Special Authentication:** The provided exploit code does not appear to require authentication to the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a large number of HTTP POST requests to `/cgi-bin/logi` with specific parameters (`PS` and `rd`).
*   The number of requests required to trigger the vulnerability varies, but can be as few as 100.
* The vulnerability is present in LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6 firmware.
