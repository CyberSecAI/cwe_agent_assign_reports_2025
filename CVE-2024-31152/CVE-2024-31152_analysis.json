  "description": "The LevelOne WBR-6012 router with firmware R0.40e6 is vulnerable to **improper resource allocation** within its web application, where a series of crafted HTTP requests can cause a reboot. This could lead to network service interruptions.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The LevelOne WBR-6012 router's web application lacks sufficient rate-limiting measures. This allows an attacker to send a large number of requests which the device cannot handle.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Resource Allocation:** The web application is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption due to the absence of proper rate-limiting.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows for a flood-based DoS attack.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Service Disruption:** Exploiting the vulnerability causes the router to crash and reboot, leading to network service interruptions.\n*  Potential **backdoor access**: The crash may enable backdoor access (related to TALOS-2024-1979)\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending HTTP POST requests over the network.\n*   **Specifically:** the attacker sends a flood of valid HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/logi` endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same network as the device, unless the web interface is exposed to the internet.\n*   **No Special Authentication:** The provided exploit code does not appear to require authentication to the web interface.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a large number of HTTP POST requests to `/cgi-bin/logi` with specific parameters (`PS` and `rd`).\n*   The number of requests required to trigger the vulnerability varies, but can be as few as 100.\n* The vulnerability is present in LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6 firmware.",

This is a child of CWE-400, **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which is a class-level weakness. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a lack of resource management, leading to a denial-of-service. While CWE-400 is a broader category, CWE-770 provides a more specific description of the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper resource allocation** (CWE-770) due to a lack of rate-limiting. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), which results in the router crashing and rebooting, causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards **improper resource allocation**, which aligns with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both support this. The key evidence is the lack of rate-limiting in the web application, which allows an attacker to exhaust the router's resources by sending a flood of HTTP requests.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-770 as a potential candidate, further supporting the assessment. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also a relevant CWE, it is a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-770. Therefore, CWE-770 is the more appropriate choice as the primary CWE.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, the CVE reference summary, and the retriever results, and the relationship analysis of the CWEs. CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
