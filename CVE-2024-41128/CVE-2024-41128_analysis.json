  "description": "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to version 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the query parameter filtering logic within the Action Dispatch component of the Ruby on Rails framework. Specifically, the way the `filtered_query_string` method processes and filters query parameters using regular expressions could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The primary vulnerability is a potential ReDoS. The original implementation used a regular expression (`PAIR_RE`) to match key-value pairs in the query string and then used string manipulation, which could cause excessive backtracking in the regular expression engine when processing specially crafted, malicious query strings. This excessive backtracking leads to a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources.\n- **Inefficient String Processing:** The initial implementation of `filtered_query_string` used `gsub` with `PAIR_RE`, which led to inefficient processing and potential for ReDoS.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted query parameters, an attacker could cause the Rails application to become unresponsive or very slow. This could effectively deny service to legitimate users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Query Parameters:** The attack vector is through HTTP query parameters. An attacker sends a crafted URL with a malicious query string to a Rails application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Rails application. No specific privileged access is required.\n- **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious query string that triggers the ReDoS vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is located in `actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/filter_parameters.rb` within the `filtered_query_string` method and in `actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/filter_redirect.rb` within the `parameter_filtered_location` method.\n- The original implementation used `query_string.gsub(PAIR_RE)` to filter parameters, which led to the backtracking issue.\n- The fix involves splitting the query string into parts based on `&` and `;`, iterating through the parts and applying the parameter filter if the part includes an equals sign (`=`).\n- The fix replaces a regular expression based approach with a split/map/join approach to avoid backtracking.\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to the patched versions of Rails or using Ruby 3.2 or newer which has mitigations for this class of ReDoS vulnerabilities.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-41128 and GHSA-x76w-6vjr-8xgj.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n- actionpack versions >= 3.1.0, < 6.1.7.9\n- actionpack versions >= 7.0.0, < 7.0.8.5\n- actionpack versions >= 7.1.0, < 7.1.4.1\n- actionpack versions >= 7.2.0, < 7.2.1.1\n\n**Patched Versions:**\n- 6.1.7.9\n- 7.0.8.5\n- 7.1.4.1\n- 7.2.1.1",

CWE-770 [CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] is related, as the inefficient regular expression leads to excessive resource consumption, but it is a consequence of the regular expression complexity, not the primary weakness.

This leads to excessive CPU consumption due to backtracking. The excessive CPU consumption can lead to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770)**, and ultimately results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **inefficient regular expression complexity (CWE-1333)**. The vulnerability description states \"there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability.\" This directly points to CWE-1333. The \"**weakness:** **regular expression denial of service**\" key phrase confirms this.\n\nCWE-770 [CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] is a consequence of the primary weakness (CWE-1333). The excessive CPU consumption caused by the inefficient regular expression leads to resource exhaustion, which aligns with CWE-770.\n\nI considered other CWEs, such as CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], but they are not relevant because the vulnerability is not due to improper neutralization of input. It is due to the inefficient regular expression.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 [CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity] is a Base CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
