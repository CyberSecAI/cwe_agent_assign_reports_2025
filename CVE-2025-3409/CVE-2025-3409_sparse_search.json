The manipulation of the argument path_to_includes leads to stack-based buffer overflow. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
