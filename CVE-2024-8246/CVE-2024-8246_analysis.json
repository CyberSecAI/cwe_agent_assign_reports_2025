  "description": "The Post Form - Registration Form - Profile Form for User Profiles - Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to **plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8246:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the \"Post Form \u2013 Registration Form \u2013 Profile Form for User Profiles \u2013 Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC)\" plugin not properly restricting access to set the default role on registration forms.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Improper Privilege Management:** The plugin allows users with contributor-level access or higher to set a custom role for new registrations.\n- **Insufficient Role Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate whether a user has the capability to promote users when setting a new user role on a registration form.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level or higher access can create a registration form that assigns the administrator role to new users. By registering through this form, the attacker can gain administrative privileges on the WordPress site.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access.\n- The attacker creates a registration form using the vulnerable plugin and configures it to assign a high-privilege role to new users (e.g. administrator).\n- The attacker, or another user, registers through this form.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with a minimum of 'Contributor' role privileges.\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to create registration forms using the vulnerable plugin.\n\n**Additional Details**\n\nThe provided changeset shows that the fix implemented in version 2.8.12 involves a check to determine if the selected new user role has the `edit_posts` capability and if the current user can `promote_users`. If the selected role has the `edit_posts` capability but the current user cannot `promote_users`, then the new user role is set to 'subscriber'. This prevents lower-level users from creating forms that register new users as administrators.",

CWE-862 Missing Authorization / CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization - The plugin fails to properly check if the user has permission to assign roles.\n3.  Impact: Privilege escalation, where an attacker gains administrator access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-266 Incorrect Privilege Assignment**, supported by the vulnerability description, which states the \"plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms\". This allows authenticated attackers to create registration forms with custom roles, leading to privilege escalation. The evidence is strong and directly points to **incorrect privilege assignment** as the root cause. The retriever results also suggested CWE-862 and CWE-863, however those are authorization issues and are not the root cause. This aligns with the MITRE guidance, which emphasizes that if the cause is a misconfigured role, **CWE-266** is the correct mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
