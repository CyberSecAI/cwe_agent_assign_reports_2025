The vulnerability description clearly states **improper input validation** as the root cause. While there might be more specific CWEs related to the type of input being validated, the provided information is insufficient to pinpoint a more precise weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is: **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) -> Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-20 as the most suitable mapping based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, both of which explicitly mention **improper input validation**. The retriever results also list CWE-20, but it is marked as \"Discouraged\" because more specific CWEs should be used if more details are available. However, given the limited information about the specific type of input validation error, CWE-20 remains the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe graph relationships show CWE-20 as a high-level class.
