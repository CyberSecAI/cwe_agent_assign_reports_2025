This is a desirable level of abstraction. There are variant-level children of CWE-79 (e.g., CWE-80, CWE-81, CWE-87), however, the provided information does not provide enough specificity to use these more specific CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe81[\"CWE-81: Improper Neutralization of Script in an Error Message Web Page\"]\n    cwe87[\"CWE-87: Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe81 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe87 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe81,cwe87 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **improper neutralization of input** (CWE-79) leads directly to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by users who visit the affected pages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based heavily on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** (Cross-site Scripting)\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that this is an XSS vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly support CWE-79 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because, while more specific variants exist, there isn't enough detail in the provided description to warrant using those variants.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
