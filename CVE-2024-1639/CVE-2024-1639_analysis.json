  "description": "The License Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the showLicenseKey() and showAllLicenseKeys() functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin dashboard access (contributors by default due to WooCommerce) to view arbitrary decrypted license keys. The functions contain a referrer nonce check. However, these can be retrieved via the dashboard through the license JS variable.",

A more specific child CWE might exist, but the provided information doesn't offer enough detail to pinpoint it. The impact of this missing authorization is the exposure of sensitive information. This aligns with the CANPRECEDE relationship from CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer to CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. CWE-862 is a parent of CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing').\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe425, cwe212 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862), leading to the exposure of decrypted license keys (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862 Missing Authorization because the vulnerability stems from a **missing capability check** in the `showLicenseKey()` and `showAllLicenseKeys()` functions. The impact of this **missing authorization** is the exposure of decrypted license keys, which aligns with CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data.\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the vulnerability description highlighting the **missing capability check** and the CVE reference links content summary explicitly mentioning \"Missing Capability Check\" and \"Improper Authorization.\"\nCWE-862 is at the Class level, and while a more specific Base or Variant CWE might exist, the available information doesn't allow for a more precise classification.\nCWE-201 is
