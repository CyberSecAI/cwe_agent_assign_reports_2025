## Vulnerability Description
The Backstage Scaffolder plugin Houses types and utilities for building scaffolder-related modules. A vulnerability is identified in Backstage Scaffolder template functionality where Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) can be exploited to perform Git config injection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture privileged git tokens used by the Backstage Scaffolder plugin. With these tokens, unauthorized access to sensitive resources in git can be achieved. The impact is considered medium severity as the Backstage Threat Model recommends restricting access to adding and editing templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin. The issue has been resolved in versions `v0.4.12`, `v0.5.1` and `v0.6.1` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` package. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may ensure that templates do not change git config.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **server-side template injection**
- **impact:** git config injection, unauthorized access to sensitive resources in git
- **product:** @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node
- **version:** before v0.4.12, v0.5.1 and v0.6.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53983:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Backstage Scaffolder plugin. This vulnerability allows for Git config injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The core vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of templates, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Git config injection:** Attackers can inject malicious git configurations via SSTI, potentially capturing privileged tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Capture of privileged git tokens:** Attackers can gain access to Git tokens used by the Backstage Scaffolder plugin.
*   **Unauthorized access to sensitive resources:** With compromised git tokens, attackers can access sensitive resources in the Git repository.
*  **Medium Severity:** Although the potential for damage is high the threat model recommends restricting access to adding and editing templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **Exploiting template functionality:** The attack vector involves exploiting the template functionality of the Backstage Scaffolder plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **High privileges required:** The attacker needs high privileges to add or edit templates within the Backstage Catalog plugin.
*   **User interaction required:** Some form of user interaction may be needed for the attack to be fully successful, as indicated by the CVSS score.
*  **Knowledge of Backstage Scaffolder:** The attacker needs an understanding of the Backstage Scaffolder plugin and its template processing mechanism.

**Additional details:**
*   **Affected versions:** Versions of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` before 0.4.12, 0.5.0, and 0.6.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 0.4.12, 0.5.1, and 0.6.1.
*   **Workaround:** Ensure templates do not change git config.
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4 (Moderate)
*   **CWE:** CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) is listed but the core vulnerability is actually SSTI which is then used to create a type of SSRF using git config injection.
