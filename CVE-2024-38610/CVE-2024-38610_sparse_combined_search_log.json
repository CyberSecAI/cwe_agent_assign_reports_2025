  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers/virt/acrn fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map() Patch series mm follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes. Patch #1 fixes a bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver. It compiles, thats all I know. Ill appreciate some review and testing from acrn folks. Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding more sanity checks, and improving the documentation. Gave it a quick test on x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte(). This patch (of 3) We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous follow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage. (1) Were not checking PTE write permissions. Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so lets check for ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now. (2) Were not rejecting refcounted pages. As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is dangerous and can result in use-after-free. Lets make sure to reject them. (3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range. We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area. Lets loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is actually contiguous. Reject everything else it couldnt have worked either way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldnt be accessing.",
