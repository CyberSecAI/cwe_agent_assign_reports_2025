  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers/virt/acrn fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map() Patch series mm follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes. Patch #1 fixes a bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver. It compiles, thats all I know. Ill appreciate some review and testing from acrn folks. Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding more sanity checks, and improving the documentation. Gave it a quick test on x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte(). This patch (of 3) We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous follow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage. (1) Were not checking PTE write permissions. Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so lets check for ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now. (2) Were not rejecting refcounted pages. As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is dangerous and can result in use-after-free. Lets make sure to reject them. (3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range. We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area. Lets loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is actually contiguous. Reject everything else it couldnt have worked either way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldnt be accessing.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability addressed by the patch:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe `acrn_vm_ram_map` function in the Linux kernel's ACRN driver, which is responsible for mapping guest RAM, was not properly validating page table entries (PTEs) when using the `VM_PFNMAP` flag. This resulted in several issues:\n  1. Lack of write permission checks on the PTE.\n  2. Failure to reject refcounted pages.\n  3. Failure to ensure contiguity of the physical frame numbers (PFNs) for larger memory ranges.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Missing PTE write permission check:** The code did not verify if the PTE had write permissions before allowing a write access request, potentially leading to unauthorized writes to memory.\n*   **Refcounted pages not rejected:** The code was not rejecting refcounted pages. These pages are managed with a reference count, and improper handling can lead to use-after-free scenarios if their reference counts are modified by the driver while being also managed by the kernel. This is especially risky as the driver does not use MMU notifiers.\n*   **Single PTE lookup:** The code was only checking the first PTE of a potentially larger range. If the memory region was larger than one page, the code would not verify the other PTEs, making it possible to map non-contiguous memory or memory that should not be accessed.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized memory access:** By exploiting the lack of write permission checks, an attacker might be able to perform unauthorized writes to the mapped memory regions.\n*   **Use-after-free:** By using refcounted pages, the driver may operate on freed memory leading to a use-after-free scenario. This can lead to system instability or code execution.\n*   **Access to incorrect PFNs:** The failure to check contiguity and only checking a single PTE may result in mapping memory that was not intended to be accessed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is within the `acrn_vm_ram_map` function, which is called when a virtual machine requests to map memory using the PFNMAP flag. A malicious user, or a compromised user process controlling the ACRN driver, could trigger this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker would need to have the ability to create or modify a virtual machine using the ACRN hypervisor, and control the parameters for memory mapping using `VM_PFNMAP`.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the kernel's ACRN driver via ioctls or similar mechanisms in order to trigger the vulnerable code path.\n\nThe provided patches fix these issues by:\n  1. Verifying write permissions for PTEs when `ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE` is set.\n  2. Rejecting refcounted pages.\n  3. Verifying contiguity of the PFN range by iterating over all PTEs within the requested memory region.",

The graph relationships helped in understanding the potential connections between the authorization issues and the resulting concurrency or null pointer issues. The selection of CWE-863 as the primary CWE is justified by the **incorrect authorization** checks. CWE-367 and CWE-476 are included as secondary issues due to the potential race condition and null pointer dereference.
