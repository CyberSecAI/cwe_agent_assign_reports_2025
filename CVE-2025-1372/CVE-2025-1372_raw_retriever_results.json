Affected by this vulnerability is the function dump_data_section/print_string_section of the file readelf.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument z/x leads to buffer overflow. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 73db9d2021cab9e23fd734b0a76a612d52a6f1db. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
