# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9472

## Vulnerability Description
A **null pointer dereference** in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected. This issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS * 10.2.7-h12 * 10.2.8-h10 * 10.2.9-h9 * 10.2.9-h11 * 10.2.10-h2 * 10.2.10-h3 * 10.2.11 * 10.2.11-h1 * 10.2.11-h2 * 10.2.11-h3 * 11.1.2-h9 * 11.1.2-h12 * 11.1.3-h2 * 11.1.3-h4 * 11.1.3-h6 * 11.2.2 * 11.2.2-h1

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **null pointer dereference**
- **impact:** PAN-OS crash and denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** specific traffic through the data plane
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
- **version:** multiple versions
- **component:** Decryption policy

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference occurs in PAN-OS software when a decryption policy is enabled. This happens when specific traffic is processed through the data plane.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can crash PAN-OS, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this will cause PAN-OS to enter maintenance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted network traffic through the data plane.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected firewall. No authentication is required. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
