  "description": "A **null pointer dereference** in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected. This issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS * 10.2.7-h12 * 10.2.8-h10 * 10.2.9-h9 * 10.2.9-h11 * 10.2.10-h2 * 10.2.10-h3 * 10.2.11 * 10.2.11-h1 * 10.2.11-h2 * 10.2.11-h3 * 11.1.2-h9 * 11.1.2-h12 * 11.1.3-h2 * 11.1.3-h4 * 11.1.3-h6 * 11.2.2 * 11.2.2-h1",

The vulnerability is caused by a **null pointer dereference** which leads to a crash. |\n| CWE-703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The description indicates an exceptional condition is not properly handled, but CWE-476 is more specific. |\n| CWE-755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. Similar to CWE-703, it describes improper handling of exceptional conditions, but CWE-476 is a more precise root cause. |\n| CWE-390 | Detection of Error Condition Without Action | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The system detects a null pointer but doesn't take appropriate action. |\n| CWE-754 | Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions | 0.4 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The system does not properly check for exceptional conditions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-476, which is a Base level CWE and directly aligns with the **null pointer dereference** described in the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-703 and CWE-755 describe more general error handling issues, CWE-476 is more specific and accurate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe390[\"CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|PEEROF| cwe703\n    cwe476 -->|PEEROF| cwe755\n    cwe476 -->|PEEROF| cwe390\n    cwe476 -->|PEEROF| cwe754\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe703,cwe755,cwe390,cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Null pointer dereference** (CWE-476) due to specific traffic being processed when decryption policy is enabled.\n2.  **Impact:** PAN-OS crash and denial of service (DoS). Repeated attempts cause PAN-OS to enter maintenance mode.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **null pointer dereference**, which directly maps to CWE-476. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary clearly points to this root cause. The other CWEs considered, such as CWE-703 and CWE-755, are more general and less specific than CWE-476. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-476 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.
