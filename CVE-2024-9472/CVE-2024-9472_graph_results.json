  "query": "A null pointer dereference in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected. This issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS * 10.2.7-h12 * 10.2.8-h10 * 10.2.9-h9 * 10.2.9-h11 * 10.2.10-h2 * 10.2.10-h3 * 10.2.11 * 10.2.11-h1 * 10.2.11-h2 * 10.2.11-h3 * 11.1.2-h9 * 11.1.2-h12 * 11.1.3-h2 * 11.1.3-h4 * 11.1.3-h6 * 11.2.2 * 11.2.2-h1",
