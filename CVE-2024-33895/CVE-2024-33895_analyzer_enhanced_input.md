## Vulnerability Description
Cosy+ devices running a firmware 21.x below 21.2s10 or a firmware 22.x below 22.1s3 use a unique key to encrypt the configuration parameters. This is fixed in version 21.2s10 and 22.1s3, the key is now unique per device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of unique key to encrypt configuration parameters**
- **product:** Cosy+ devices
- **version:** 21.x below 21.2s10 or a firmware 22.x below 22.1s3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-33895:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Ewon Cosy+ devices use a hardcoded cryptographic key for encrypting configuration parameters and passwords. This key is stored within the `/usr/bin/ewon` binary in the `.rodata` section.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The same key is used across all devices for password encryption, instead of a unique key per device or utilizing the HSM for key management.
*   **Inadequate Encryption:** Passwords and sensitive data are encrypted using AES in CBC mode, but with a hardcoded key and IV, making it possible to decrypt the data once the key and IV are known.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can decrypt sensitive information like passwords stored in the device's configuration and backup files.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Decrypted passwords could lead to unauthorized access to the device's administrative interface, and to other systems and services that are protected by these passwords.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Access to Device Firmware:** Attackers who gain access to the device's firmware image or the `/usr/bin/ewon` binary can extract the hardcoded key and IV. This could be achieved through:
    *   Root access to the device via other vulnerabilities like the described OS command injection or XSS attacks.
    *   Physical access to the device to extract the firmware.
*  **Offline decryption:** Once the key and IV are obtained, an attacker can decrypt configuration files and backups offline without the need to access the device directly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Technical Expertise:** Ability to perform reverse engineering of binaries and understanding of cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Access to Firmware/Binary:** Ability to obtain the device's firmware or access the `/usr/bin/ewon` binary. This could be achieved by:
    *  Gaining root access to the device.
    *  Physical access to the device.
    *  Obtaining a firmware file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Ewon Cosy+ devices running firmware versions below 21.2s10 or 22.1s3.
*   The vendor has addressed this issue in the mentioned firmware versions by implementing unique keys per device.
*   The blog post provides a Python script that can be used to decrypt passwords, highlighting the simplicity of exploitation once the hardcoded key and IV are known.

The information provided in the blog post and the security advisory from HMS Networks provides more technical details about the vulnerability than the basic CVE description would. This includes details on the encryption process, the location of the key, and how to decrypt passwords.
