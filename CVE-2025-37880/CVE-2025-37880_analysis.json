  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved um work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS). Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a sched_yield syscall.",

Several other CWEs were considered, including CWE-667 and CWE-833, based on the description of the vulnerability as a potential deadlock or slowdown due to improper synchronization. CWE-362's children include CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition). CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is related as it can lead to race conditions. CWE-833 (Deadlock) is a possible consequence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|PEEROF| cwe362\n    cwe833 -->|PEEROF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe833 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a badly implemented userspace spinlock, which in time-travel mode of the Linux kernel, leads to either extreme slowdown or deadlock.\n\nBadly implemented userspace spinlock -> **CWE-362** (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) -> Extreme slowdown or **CWE-833** (Deadlock)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the improperly implemented userspace spinlock that leads to a race condition when the kernel is in time-travel mode.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **spinlock** and the possibility of a **deadlock**, pushing to consider CWE-667 and CWE-833 as well. The description indicates a problem with scheduling and timing, leading to the selection of CWE-362 as the most appropriate **root cause**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes: \"badly implemented userspace spinlock\", \"extreme slowdown or even deadlock\", \"sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connections between race conditions, improper locking, and deadlocks.\n\nCWE-362 is a Class, which per the Mapping Guidance, may have more appropriate Base-level children, but none of the children seem to be a better fit than CWE-362.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
