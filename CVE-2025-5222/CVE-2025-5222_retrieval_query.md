# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-5222

# Vulnerability Description

    A **stack buffer overflow** was found in Internationl components for unicode (ICU ). While running the genrb binary, the subtag struct overflowed at the SRBRootaddTag function. This issue may lead to **memory corruption** and local arbitrary code execution.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'stack buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 286.71)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....

### 2. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Score: 268.54)

The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 262.02)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 256.56)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 253.45)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 227.16)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....
