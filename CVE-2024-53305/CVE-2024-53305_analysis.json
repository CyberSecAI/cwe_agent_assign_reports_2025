  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, this relates to **CVE-2024-53305**. The content provides more detail than the official CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of data using `pickle` in the `whoogle-search` application, specifically within the `config.py` file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure deserialization: Using `pickle.loads` to deserialize data received from user input (preferences) is inherently dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution.\n*   Lack of input validation: The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the data being deserialized.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running the `whoogle-search` application.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector involves sending a malicious payload through the `preferences` parameter in a search request. The payload is base64 encoded, brotli compressed, and then URL encoded.\n*   Specifically, the exploit targets the `app/models/config.py#L265` line, which is where the insecure pickle deserialization occurs.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `whoogle-search` instance. No authentication is required.\n*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious pickle payload.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was patched in commit [223f00c3c0533423114f99b30c561278bc0b42ba](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/commit/223f00c3c0533423114f99b30c561278bc0b42ba) by replacing `pickle` with `json` for configuration encoding. This eliminates the risk of arbitrary code execution through deserialization.\n\n**Payload details:**\n\nThe provided code snippet includes a Python script (`whoogle.py`) that demonstrates how to construct and send the malicious payload. It defines a class `P` with a `__reduce__` method that executes an arbitrary shell command (`python3 -c '...'`) when deserialized. The payload is then encoded and sent as the value of the `preferences` parameter in a GET request.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n*   The content explicitly states that the provided code is an exploit for the RCE vulnerability.\n*   The exploit targets a specific server (`[SERVER]`) and port (`[IP]`, `[PORT]`).\n*   The exploit uses brotli compression and base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload.",

CWE-502 is the root cause, while CWE-94 is the direct consequence of the deserialization. CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-95, which is about Eval Injection but that is not the case here, as the deserialization directly leads to code execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe502\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** because the application uses `pickle.loads` on user-provided data without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, which is then executed, leading to **CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** as the primary CWE. The CVE description and summary clearly indicate that the root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure deserialization of data using `pickle`. The application **fails to validate** the data being deserialized, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code. The evidence is the following: \"The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of data using `pickle` in the `whoogle-search` application\" and \"Using `pickle.loads` to deserialize data received from user input (preferences) is inherently dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution.\"\n**CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** is selected as a secondary CWE because the deserialization directly leads to code execution.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-74, CWE-89, CWE-90, CWE-917, CWE-1336: These are all related to injection but are not the root cause in this case.
