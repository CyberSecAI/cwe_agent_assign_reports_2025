This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function.

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files. These formulas may result in arbitrary code execution on a victim's computer when opening the exported files with Microsoft Excel.\n\n- CVE-2022-27858: CSV Injection vulnerability in Activity Log Team Activity Log <= 2.8.3 on WordPress. \n\n- CVE-2022-1544: Formula Injection/CSV Injection due to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in CSV File in GitHub repository luyadev/yii-helpers prior to 1.2.1.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue.

Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25298: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/cloud-vm/cloud-vm.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-27101: Accellion FTA 9_12_370 and earlier is affected by SQL injection via a crafted Host header in a request to document_root.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_380 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-35394: Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a diagnostic tool called 'MP Daemon' that is usually compiled as 'UDPServer' binary. The binary is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities and an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers.\n\n- CVE-2022-26352: An issue was discovered in the ContentResource API in dotCMS 3.0 through 22.02. Attackers can craft a multipart form request to post a file whose filename is not initially sanitized. This allows directory traversal, in which the file is saved outside of the intended storage location. If anonymous content creation is enabled, this allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an executable file, such as a .jsp file, that can lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-27926: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /public/launchNewWindow.jsp component of Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 9.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML via request parameters.\n\n- CVE-2022-22221: An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in the download manager of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to take full control over the device. One aspect of this vulnerability is that the attacker needs to be able to execute any of the \"request ...\" or \"show system download ...\" commands. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series: All versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2, 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2022-3047: Insufficient policy enforcement in Extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass downloads policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21705: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-24039: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884).

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.\n\n- CVE-2021-40084: opensysusers through 0.6 does not safely use eval on files in sysusers.d that may contain shell metacharacters. For example, it allows command execution via a crafted GECOS field whereas systemd-sysusers (a program with the same specification) does not do that.\n\n- CVE-2021-42057: Obsidian Dataview through 0.4.12-hotfix1 allows eval injection. The evalInContext function in executes user input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious Markdown files that will execute arbitrary code once opened. NOTE: 0.4.13 provides a mitigation for some use cases.\n\n- CVE-2021-32756: ManageIQ is an open-source management platform. In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker controlled commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40871: Dolibarr ERP & CRM <=15.0.3 is vulnerable to Eval injection. By default, any administrator can be added to the installation page of dolibarr, and if successfully added, malicious code can be inserted into the database and then execute it by eval.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Improper neutralization of user data in the DjVu file format in ExifTool versions 7.44 and up allows arbitrary code execution when parsing the malicious image\n\n- CVE-2022-0845: Code Injection in GitHub repository pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning prior to 1.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-29216: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2022-38193: There is a code injection vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.8.1 and below that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass strings which could potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-46648: ruby-git versions prior to v1.13.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary ruby code by having a user to load a repository containing a specially crafted filename to the product.

This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1250 (ChildOf)",

However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36349: insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n\n- CVE-2022-42467: A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34795: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Catalyst Passive Optical Network (PON) Series Switches Optical Network Terminal (ONT) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform the following actions: Log in with a default credential if the Telnet protocol is enabled Perform command injection Modify the configuration For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2020-10279: MiR robot controllers (central computation unit) makes use of Ubuntu 16.04.2 an operating system, Thought for desktop uses, this operating system presents insecure defaults for robots. These insecurities include a way for users to escalate their access beyond what they were granted via file creation, access race conditions, insecure home directory configurations and defaults that facilitate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-28123: Undocumented Default Cryptographic Key Vulnerability in Cohesity DataPlatform version 6.3 prior 6.3.1g, 6.4 up to 6.4.1c and 6.5.1 through 6.5.1b. The ssh key can provide an attacker access to the linux system in the affected version.\n\n- CVE-2021-40825: nLight ECLYPSE (nECY) system Controllers running software prior to 1.17.21245.754 contain a default key vulnerability. The nECY does not force a change to the key upon the initial configuration of an affected device. nECY system controllers utilize an encrypted channel to secure SensorViewTM configuration and monitoring software and nECY to nECY communications. Impacted devices are at risk of exploitation. A remote attacker with IP access to an impacted device could submit lighting control commands to the nECY by leveraging the default key. A successful attack may result in the attacker gaining the ability to modify lighting conditions or gain the ability to update the software on lighting devices. The impacted key is referred to as the SensorView Password in the nECY nLight Explorer Interface and the Gateway Password in the SensorView application. An attacker cannot authenticate to or modify the configuration or software of the nECY system controller.\n\n- CVE-2021-35965: The Orca HCM digital learning platform uses a weak factory default administrator password, which is hard-coded in the source code of the webpage in plain text, thus remote attackers can obtain administrator\u2019s privilege without logging in.\n\n- CVE-2020-12732: DEPSTECH WiFi Digital Microscope 3 has a default SSID of Jetion_xxxxxxxx with a password of 12345678.\n\n- CVE-2021-34203: D-Link DIR-2640-US 1.01B04 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Router ac2600 (dir-2640-us), when setting PPPoE, will start quagga process in the way of whole network monitoring, and this function uses the original default password and port. An attacker can easily use telnet to log in, modify routing information, monitor the traffic of all devices under the router, hijack DNS and phishing attacks. In addition, this interface is likely to be questioned by customers as a backdoor, because the interface should not be exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-35336: Tieline IP Audio Gateway 2.6.4.8 and below is affected by Incorrect Access Control. A vulnerability in the Tieline Web Administrative Interface could allow an unauthenticated user to access a sensitive part of the system with a high privileged account.\n\n- CVE-2021-42109: VITEC Exterity IPTV products through 2021-04-30 allow privilege escalation to root.\n\n- CVE-2021-0468: In LK, there is a possible escalation of privilege due to an insecure default value. This could lead to local escalation of privilege for an attacker who has physical access to the device with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-180427272\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: Raspberry Pi OS through 5.10 has the raspberry default password for the pi account. If not changed, attackers can gain administrator privileges.\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to allow all API requests without authentication, but this poses security risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the default has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-authentication. Note this change fixes it for new installs but existing users need to change their config to default `[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned in the Updating Guide: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.11/UPDATING.md#experimental-api-will-deny-all-request-by-default\n\n- CVE-2022-24706: In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges. The CouchDB documentation has always made recommendations for properly securing an installation, including recommending using a firewall in front of all CouchDB installations.\n\n- CVE-2022-42467: When running in prototype mode, the h2 webconsole module (accessible from the Prototype menu) is automatically made available with the ability to directly query the database. It was felt that it is safer to require the developer to explicitly enable this capability. As of 2.0.0-M8, this can now be done using the 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access' configuration property; the web console will be unavailable without setting this configuration. As an additional safeguard, the new 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password' configuration parameter (enabled by default) requires that the administrator use a randomly generated password to use the console. The password is printed to the log, as \"webAdminPass: xxx\" (where \"xxx\") is the password. To revert to the original behaviour, the administrator would therefore need to set these configuration parameter: isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access=true isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password=false Note also that the h2 webconsole is never available in production mode, so these safeguards are only to ensure that the webconsole is secured by default also in prototype mode.\n\n- CVE-2022-25568: MotionEye v0.42.1 and below allows attackers to access sensitive information via a GET request to /config/list. To exploit this vulnerability, a regular user password must be unconfigured.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1419 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)",

            "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n",

This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.

This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function. An authenticated malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to embed untrusted data prior to exporting a CSV sheet through Log Insight which could be executed in user's environment.\n\n- CVE-2021-20509: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files. These formulas may result in arbitrary code execution on a victim's computer when opening the exported files with Microsoft Excel.\n\n- CVE-2022-27858: CSV Injection vulnerability in Activity Log Team Activity Log <= 2.8.3 on WordPress. \n\n- CVE-2022-1544: Formula Injection/CSV Injection due to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in CSV File in GitHub repository luyadev/yii-helpers prior to 1.2.1. Successful exploitation can lead to impacts such as client-sided command injection, code execution, or remote ex-filtration of contained confidential data.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)",

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection.

When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options.

            "matched_text": "CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\nExtended Details:\n\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25298: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/cloud-vm/cloud-vm.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-27101: Accellion FTA 9_12_370 and earlier is affected by SQL injection via a crafted Host header in a request to document_root.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_380 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-35394: Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a diagnostic tool called 'MP Daemon' that is usually compiled as 'UDPServer' binary. The binary is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities and an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers.\n\n- CVE-2022-26352: An issue was discovered in the ContentResource API in dotCMS 3.0 through 22.02. Attackers can craft a multipart form request to post a file whose filename is not initially sanitized. This allows directory traversal, in which the file is saved outside of the intended storage location. If anonymous content creation is enabled, this allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an executable file, such as a .jsp file, that can lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-27926: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /public/launchNewWindow.jsp component of Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 9.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML via request parameters.\n\n- CVE-2022-22221: An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in the download manager of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to take full control over the device. One aspect of this vulnerability is that the attacker needs to be able to execute any of the \"request ...\" or \"show system download ...\" commands. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series: All versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2, 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2022-3047: Insufficient policy enforcement in Extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass downloads policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21705: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-24039: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.\n\n- CVE-2022-35948: undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`=< undici@5.8.0` users are vulnerable to _CRLF Injection_ on headers when using unsanitized input as request headers, more specifically, inside the `content-type` header. Example: ``` import { request } from 'undici' const unsanitizedContentTypeInput = 'application/json\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGET /foo2 HTTP/1.1' await request('http://localhost:3000, { method: 'GET', headers: { 'content-type': unsanitizedContentTypeInput }, }) ``` The above snippet will perform two requests in a single `request` API call: 1) `http://localhost:3000/` 2) `http://localhost:3000/foo2` This issue was patched in Undici v5.8.1. Sanitize input when sending content-type headers using user input as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-24942: The Menu Item Visibility Control WordPress plugin through 0.5 doesn't sanitize and validate the \"Visibility logic\" option for WordPress menu items, which could allow highly privileged users to execute arbitrary PHP code even in a hardened environment.\n\n- CVE-2022-0819: Code Injection in GitHub repository dolibarr/dolibarr prior to 15.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-25644: All versions of package @pendo324/get-process-by-name are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to improper sanitization of getProcessByName function.\n\n- CVE-2022-46161: pdfmake is an open source client/server side PDF printing in pure JavaScript.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27928: A remote code execution issue was discovered in MariaDB 10.2 before 10.2.37, 10.3 before 10.3.28, 10.4 before 10.4.18, and 10.5 before 10.5.9; Percona Server through 2021-03-03; and the wsrep patch through 2021-03-03 for MySQL. An untrusted search path leads to eval injection, in which a database SUPER user can execute OS commands after modifying wsrep_provider and wsrep_notify_cmd. NOTE: this does not affect an Oracle product.\n\n- CVE-2021-3725: Vulnerability in dirhistory plugin Description: the widgets that go back and forward in the directory history, triggered by pressing Alt-Left and Alt-Right, use functions that unsafely execute eval on directory names.

In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability.

Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site.

This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1250 (ChildOf)",

An attacker cannot authenticate to or modify the configuration or software of the nECY system controller.\n\n- CVE-2021-35965: The Orca HCM digital learning platform uses a weak factory default administrator password, which is hard-coded in the source code of the webpage in plain text, thus remote attackers can obtain administrator\u2019s privilege without logging in.\n\n- CVE-2020-12732: DEPSTECH WiFi Digital Microscope 3 has a default SSID of Jetion_xxxxxxxx with a password of 12345678.\n\n- CVE-2021-34203: D-Link DIR-2640-US 1.01B04 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Router ac2600 (dir-2640-us), when setting PPPoE, will start quagga process in the way of whole network monitoring, and this function uses the original default password and port. An attacker can easily use telnet to log in, modify routing information, monitor the traffic of all devices under the router, hijack DNS and phishing attacks. In addition, this interface is likely to be questioned by customers as a backdoor, because the interface should not be exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-35336: Tieline IP Audio Gateway 2.6.4.8 and below is affected by Incorrect Access Control. A vulnerability in the Tieline Web Administrative Interface could allow an unauthenticated user to access a sensitive part of the system with a high privileged account.\n\n- CVE-2021-42109: VITEC Exterity IPTV products through 2021-04-30 allow privilege escalation to root.\n\n- CVE-2021-0468: In LK, there is a possible escalation of privilege due to an insecure default value. This could lead to local escalation of privilege for an attacker who has physical access to the device with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-180427272\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: Raspberry Pi OS through 5.10 has the raspberry default password for the pi account. If not changed, attackers can gain administrator privileges.\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to allow all API requests without authentication, but this poses security risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the default has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-authentication. Note this change fixes it for new installs but existing users need to change their config to default `[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned in the Updating Guide: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.11/UPDATING.md#experimental-api-will-deny-all-request-by-default\n\n- CVE-2022-24706: In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges. The CouchDB documentation has always made recommendations for properly securing an installation, including recommending using a firewall in front of all CouchDB installations.\n\n- CVE-2022-42467: When running in prototype mode, the h2 webconsole module (accessible from the Prototype menu) is automatically made available with the ability to directly query the database. It was felt that it is safer to require the developer to explicitly enable this capability. As of 2.0.0-M8, this can now be done using the 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access' configuration property; the web console will be unavailable without setting this configuration. As an additional safeguard, the new 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password' configuration parameter (enabled by default) requires that the administrator use a randomly generated password to use the console. The password is printed to the log, as \"webAdminPass: xxx\" (where \"xxx\") is the password. To revert to the original behaviour, the administrator would therefore need to set these configuration parameter: isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access=true isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password=false Note also that the h2 webconsole is never available in production mode, so these safeguards are only to ensure that the webconsole is secured by default also in prototype mode.\n\n- CVE-2022-25568: MotionEye v0.42.1 and below allows attackers to access sensitive information via a GET request to /config/list. To exploit this vulnerability, a regular user password must be unconfigured.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1419 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)",

While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n### Extended Description\nUser-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCSV Injection\nFormula Injection\nExcel Macro Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase\nSQLi: a common abbreviation for \"SQL injection\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \"HTML injection\" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.\n- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.\n- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses externally-provided data to build prompts provided to\nlarge language models (LLMs), but the way these prompts are constructed\ncauses the LLM to fail to distinguish between user-supplied inputs and\ndeveloper provided system directives.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n When prompts are constructed using externally controllable data, it is often possible to cause an LLM to ignore the original guidance provided by its creators (known as the \"system prompt\") by inserting malicious instructions in plain human language or using bypasses such as special characters or tags. Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as legitimate, there is often no way for the model to differentiate between what prompt language is malicious when it performs inference and returns data. Many LLM systems incorporate data from other adjacent products or external data sources like Wikipedia using API calls and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that may contain untrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nprompt injection: attack-oriented term for modifying prompts, whether due to this weakness or other weaknesses\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Ensure that the weakness being identified involves improper neutralization during prompt generation. A different CWE might be needed if the core concern is related to inadvertent insertion of sensitive information, generating prompts from third-party sources that should not have been trusted (as may occur with indirect prompt injection), or jailbreaking, then the root cause might be a different weakness.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** ML-based email analysis product uses an API service that allows a malicious user to inject a direct prompt and take over the service logic, forcing it to leak the standard hard-coded system prompts and/or execute unwanted prompts to leak sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Chain: library for generating SQL via LLMs using RAG uses a prompt function to present the user with visualized results, allowing altering of the prompt using prompt injection (CWE-1427) to run arbitrary Python code (CWE-94) instead of the intended visualization code.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-138\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n",

This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function. An authenticated malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to embed untrusted data prior to exporting a CSV sheet through Log Insight which could be executed in user's environment.\n\n- CVE-2021-20509: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files. These formulas may result in arbitrary code execution on a victim's computer when opening the exported files with Microsoft Excel.\n\n- CVE-2022-27858: CSV Injection vulnerability in Activity Log Team Activity Log <= 2.8.3 on WordPress. \n\n- CVE-2022-1544: Formula Injection/CSV Injection due to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in CSV File in GitHub repository luyadev/yii-helpers prior to 1.2.1. Successful exploitation can lead to impacts such as client-sided command injection, code execution, or remote ex-filtration of contained confidential data.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)",

In some situations, this will simply lead to no results being returned by the query builder; however, it is possible certain queries could be affected in a way that causes the query to return unexpected results.\n\n- CVE-2021-43038: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance before 10.5.5.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27928: A remote code execution issue was discovered in MariaDB 10.2 before 10.2.37, 10.3 before 10.3.28, 10.4 before 10.4.18, and 10.5 before 10.5.9; Percona Server through 2021-03-03; and the wsrep patch through 2021-03-03 for MySQL. An untrusted search path leads to eval injection, in which a database SUPER user can execute OS commands after modifying wsrep_provider and wsrep_notify_cmd. NOTE: this does not affect an Oracle product.\n\n- CVE-2021-3725: Vulnerability in dirhistory plugin Description: the widgets that go back and forward in the directory history, triggered by pressing Alt-Left and Alt-Right, use functions that unsafely execute eval on directory names. If you cd into a directory with a carefully-crafted name, then press Alt-Left, the system is subject to command injection. Impacted areas: - Functions pop_past and pop_future in dirhistory plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-21278: RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.\n\n- CVE-2021-40084: opensysusers through 0.6 does not safely use eval on files in sysusers.d that may contain shell metacharacters. For example, it allows command execution via a crafted GECOS field whereas systemd-sysusers (a program with the same specification) does not do that.\n\n- CVE-2021-42057: Obsidian Dataview through 0.4.12-hotfix1 allows eval injection. The evalInContext function in executes user input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious Markdown files that will execute arbitrary code once opened. NOTE: 0.4.13 provides a mitigation for some use cases.\n\n- CVE-2021-32756: ManageIQ is an open-source management platform. In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker controlled commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40871: Dolibarr ERP & CRM <=15.0.3 is vulnerable to Eval injection. By default, any administrator can be added to the installation page of dolibarr, and if successfully added, malicious code can be inserted into the database and then execute it by eval.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Improper neutralization of user data in the DjVu file format in ExifTool versions 7.44 and up allows arbitrary code execution when parsing the malicious image\n\n- CVE-2022-0845: Code Injection in GitHub repository pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning prior to 1.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-29216: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2022-38193: There is a code injection vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.8.1 and below that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass strings which could potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-46648: ruby-git versions prior to v1.13.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary ruby code by having a user to load a repository containing a specially crafted filename to the product. This vulnerability is different from CVE-2022-47318.\n\n- CVE-2021-40553: piwigo 11.5.0 is affected by a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the LocalFiles Editor.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Code Injection in GitHub repository nuitka/nuitka prior to 0.9. \n\n- CVE-2022-45907: In PyTorch before trunk/89695, torch.jit.annotations.parse_type_line can cause arbitrary code execution because eval is used unsafely.\n\n- CVE-2022-46333: The admin user interface in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection (PPS/PoD) contains a command injection vulnerability that enables an admin to execute commands beyond their allowed scope. This affects all versions 8.19.0 and below. \n\n- CVE-2022-48175: Rukovoditel v3.2.1 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the component /rukovoditel/index.php?module=dashboard/ajax_request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-94 (ChildOf)",

This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1250 (ChildOf)",

However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36349: insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n\n- CVE-2022-42467: A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34795: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Catalyst Passive Optical Network (PON) Series Switches Optical Network Terminal (ONT) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform the following actions: Log in with a default credential if the Telnet protocol is enabled Perform command injection Modify the configuration For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2020-10279: MiR robot controllers (central computation unit) makes use of Ubuntu 16.04.2 an operating system, Thought for desktop uses, this operating system presents insecure defaults for robots. These insecurities include a way for users to escalate their access beyond what they were granted via file creation, access race conditions, insecure home directory configurations and defaults that facilitate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-28123: Undocumented Default Cryptographic Key Vulnerability in Cohesity DataPlatform version 6.3 prior 6.3.1g, 6.4 up to 6.4.1c and 6.5.1 through 6.5.1b. The ssh key can provide an attacker access to the linux system in the affected version.\n\n- CVE-2021-40825: nLight ECLYPSE (nECY) system Controllers running software prior to 1.17.21245.754 contain a default key vulnerability. The nECY does not force a change to the key upon the initial configuration of an affected device. nECY system controllers utilize an encrypted channel to secure SensorViewTM configuration and monitoring software and nECY to nECY communications. Impacted devices are at risk of exploitation. A remote attacker with IP access to an impacted device could submit lighting control commands to the nECY by leveraging the default key. A successful attack may result in the attacker gaining the ability to modify lighting conditions or gain the ability to update the software on lighting devices. The impacted key is referred to as the SensorView Password in the nECY nLight Explorer Interface and the Gateway Password in the SensorView application. An attacker cannot authenticate to or modify the configuration or software of the nECY system controller.\n\n- CVE-2021-35965: The Orca HCM digital learning platform uses a weak factory default administrator password, which is hard-coded in the source code of the webpage in plain text, thus remote attackers can obtain administrator\u2019s privilege without logging in.\n\n- CVE-2020-12732: DEPSTECH WiFi Digital Microscope 3 has a default SSID of Jetion_xxxxxxxx with a password of 12345678.\n\n- CVE-2021-34203: D-Link DIR-2640-US 1.01B04 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Router ac2600 (dir-2640-us), when setting PPPoE, will start quagga process in the way of whole network monitoring, and this function uses the original default password and port. An attacker can easily use telnet to log in, modify routing information, monitor the traffic of all devices under the router, hijack DNS and phishing attacks. In addition, this interface is likely to be questioned by customers as a backdoor, because the interface should not be exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-35336: Tieline IP Audio Gateway 2.6.4.8 and below is affected by Incorrect Access Control. A vulnerability in the Tieline Web Administrative Interface could allow an unauthenticated user to access a sensitive part of the system with a high privileged account.\n\n- CVE-2021-42109: VITEC Exterity IPTV products through 2021-04-30 allow privilege escalation to root.\n\n- CVE-2021-0468: In LK, there is a possible escalation of privilege due to an insecure default value. This could lead to local escalation of privilege for an attacker who has physical access to the device with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-180427272\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: Raspberry Pi OS through 5.10 has the raspberry default password for the pi account. If not changed, attackers can gain administrator privileges.\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to allow all API requests without authentication, but this poses security risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the default has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-authentication. Note this change fixes it for new installs but existing users need to change their config to default `[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned in the Updating Guide: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.11/UPDATING.md#experimental-api-will-deny-all-request-by-default\n\n- CVE-2022-24706: In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges. The CouchDB documentation has always made recommendations for properly securing an installation, including recommending using a firewall in front of all CouchDB installations.\n\n- CVE-2022-42467: When running in prototype mode, the h2 webconsole module (accessible from the Prototype menu) is automatically made available with the ability to directly query the database. It was felt that it is safer to require the developer to explicitly enable this capability. As of 2.0.0-M8, this can now be done using the 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access' configuration property; the web console will be unavailable without setting this configuration. As an additional safeguard, the new 'isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password' configuration parameter (enabled by default) requires that the administrator use a randomly generated password to use the console. The password is printed to the log, as \"webAdminPass: xxx\" (where \"xxx\") is the password. To revert to the original behaviour, the administrator would therefore need to set these configuration parameter: isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access=true isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password=false Note also that the h2 webconsole is never available in production mode, so these safeguards are only to ensure that the webconsole is secured by default also in prototype mode.\n\n- CVE-2022-25568: MotionEye v0.42.1 and below allows attackers to access sensitive information via a GET request to /config/list. To exploit this vulnerability, a regular user password must be unconfigured.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1419 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

          "extended_description": "\n\nMany products provide web-based applications or other interfaces for managing the underlying operating system. This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.
