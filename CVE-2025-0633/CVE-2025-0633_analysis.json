CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) can be a consequence of a buffer overflow. The abstraction levels influenced the choice, favoring the more specific Variant level (CWE-122) over the more general Class level (CWE-119).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe126\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe126 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** (CWE-122), which allows an attacker to read out-of-bounds memory (CWE-126). The root cause is the **improper** handling of memory boundaries on the heap.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-122 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**\". The impact, \"read out of bound memory,\" suggests CWE-126, Buffer Over-read, as a secondary weakness resulting from the overflow.\n\nThe graph relationships support this by showing CWE-122 as a specific type of CWE-119, and it can lead to CWE-126. The selection of CWE-122 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the type of buffer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
