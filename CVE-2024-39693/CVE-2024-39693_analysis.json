While CWE-400 is discouraged, its children CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value] provide more specific classifications that may apply. The relationship analysis suggests that the vulnerability may involve uncontrolled allocation of resources, potentially memory, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **bug** in Next.js, which allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). The **root cause** is the **uncontrolled consumption of resources**, leading to a server crash and impacting availability.\n\nVulnerability Chain:\n1.  **Bug** in Next.js (Specific technical cause unknown)\n2.  CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] (**Root Cause**)\n3.  Denial of Service (DoS) (**Impact**)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in Next.js. The provided evidence indicates that a **bug** exists that can be exploited to cause a server crash, impacting availability. Based on the retriever results and the vulnerability description, CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] seems like the most appropriate primary CWE, even though it's discouraged. The description mentions a DoS condition, which aligns with the impact of uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nCWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value] were also considered as potential candidates because they are children of CWE-400 and specify different types of resource consumption. Without more information about the specific **bug**, it's difficult to select one over the other with high confidence.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400, CWE-770 and CWE-789 is at the appropriate level of specificity given the available information. More information on the exact technical details of the **bug** would be needed to refine the classification further.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
