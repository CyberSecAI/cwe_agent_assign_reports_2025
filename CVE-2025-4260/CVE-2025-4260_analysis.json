  "description": "A vulnerability was found in zhangyanbo2007 youkefu up to 4.2.0 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function impsave of the file m\\\\web\\\\handler\\\\admin\\\\system\\\\TemplateController.java. The manipulation of the argument dataFile leads to **deserialization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
