This issue affects the function wabtinterp(anonymous namespace)BinaryReaderInterpOnExport of the file wabt/src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
