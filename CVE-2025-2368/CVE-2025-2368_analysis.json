  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2368 based on provided content\n\nBased on the provided content, specifically the GitHub issue #2556, the following information can be extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `wabt::interp::(anonymous namespace)::BinaryReaderInterp::OnExport` function. It occurs when processing malformed files, specifically when calling `FuncType::Clone()` within a switch statement. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow.\n*   **Insufficient bounds checking:** The `FuncType::Clone()` call doesn't properly validate the size or boundaries of the data being accessed, leading to the overflow.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Application crash:** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash.\n*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, depending on the surrounding memory layout and other factors.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Malformed WASM files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted, malformed WebAssembly (WASM) files.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Ability to create/provide malicious WASM files:** An attacker needs to be able to create or provide a WASM file that triggers the vulnerability.\n*   **Local or remote access:** Depending on how the `wabt` tools are used, the attacker may need local access to the system or the ability to deliver the malicious file remotely.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe provided content does not detail a specific fix. However, the issue description implies that proper bounds checking within the `FuncType::Clone()` function or the `OnExport` function is necessary to prevent the overflow.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Reproducibility:** The issue includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability using a fuzzer (OSS-Fuzz) and a provided PoC.\n*   **Affected version:** wabt v1.0.36 is identified as affected.\n*   **Code location:** The vulnerable code is located in `wabt/src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc` at line 693.\n*   **Fuzzing context:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.\n*   **AddressSanitizer report:** The report includes an AddressSanitizer (ASan) output, pinpointing the exact memory location and call stack involved in the overflow.\n*   **Related Issue:** Issue #2537 discusses the intended use cases of the binary reader options and the potential risks of running broken modules in the interpreter.\n*   **Pull Request:** Pull Request #2541 aims to make `ReadBinaryOptions` more strict across readers.\n*   **CIFuzz impact:** The fix may break compatibility with CIFuzz, requiring coordination between repositories.\n\n**CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-2368 as it describes a heap-based buffer overflow in the wabt project, which is the subject of the CVE.",

CWE-122 specifically describes a buffer overflow occurring in the heap, which aligns with the vulnerability description. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is included as a potential related issue, as the vulnerability description mentions an out-of-bounds read condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|PEEROF| cwe122\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **malformed file** leading to **improper handling** within the `BinaryReaderInterpOnExport` function, specifically the `FuncType::Clone()` call. This results in a **heap-based buffer overflow**, and subsequently, an **out-of-bounds read**, potentially causing an **application crash** or even **arbitrary code execution**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Malformed File, leading to incorrect execution path\n  - **Weakness 1:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)\n  - **Weakness 2:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)\n  - **Impact:** Application Crash / Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in classifying this vulnerability as a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). This is supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"heap-based buffer overflow,\" and the CVE reference summary which elaborates on the vulnerable function and the conditions leading to the overflow.\n\nThe primary evidence for CWE-122 is: \"The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**.\"\nThe secondary evidence for CWE-125 is: \"It occurs when processing malformed files, specifically when calling `FuncType::Clone()` within a switch statement. This leads to an **out-of-bounds read**.\"\n\nCWE-119 is a broader category, and while technically applicable, CWE-122 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-122 having a relatively high score.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-122 accurately captures the type of buffer overflow (heap-based), while CWE-125 identifies the resulting out-of-bounds read.
