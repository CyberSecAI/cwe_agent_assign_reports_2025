  "description": "**Exposure of Sensitive Information** to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot. This issue affects Apache Pinot from 0.1 before 1.0.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue. Details When using a request to path /appconfigs to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the Role-based Access Control https//docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39676:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the `/appconfigs` endpoint in Apache Pinot versions prior to 1.0.0. This endpoint, without proper access control, discloses sensitive information.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Lack of Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control on the `/appconfigs` endpoint. This allows unauthorized actors to access the endpoint and retrieve sensitive information.\n- **Information Exposure:** The `/appconfigs` endpoint leaks sensitive information, including:\n    - System information (e.g., arch, OS version)\n    - Environment information (e.g., maxHeapSize)\n    - Pinot configurations (e.g., Zookeeper path)\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain sensitive system, environment, and configuration data, which can be used to gain further knowledge about the system, plan further attacks or compromise the system itself.\n-  Potentially can lead to further compromise of the system based on the information gathered.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Apache Pinot controller can send a request to the `/appconfigs` endpoint.\n- **Unauthorized Endpoint Access:** The attacker exploits the lack of authentication and authorization on the `/appconfigs` endpoint to retrieve the sensitive information.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Apache Pinot controller where the vulnerable endpoint is exposed.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to access the vulnerable endpoint prior to the fix in 1.0.0",

CWE-306 is a more specific (Base) case of a broader authentication issue, whereas CWE-200 describes the impact. The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication which directly leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306). This **weakness** allows unauthorized access to the `/appconfigs` endpoint, which results in the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs based on the vulnerability description. The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as top candidates.\n\nHowever, based on the vulnerability details and the CWE classification guidance, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was selected as the primary CWE. The evidence clearly states that the `/appconfigs` endpoint lacks proper access control, allowing unauthorized access. This aligns with the definition of CWE-306, which focuses on the absence of authentication for critical functions.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"When using a request to path /appconfigs to the controller, it can lead to the **disclosure of sensitive information** such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path).\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this, stating: \"**Lack of Access Control:** The primary **weakness** is the absence of proper access control on the `/appconfigs` endpoint. This allows unauthorized actors to access the endpoint and retrieve sensitive information.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the missing authentication. However, it's a Class-level CWE and discouraged for use as a primary root cause.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was not selected because the issue is not with an incorrect authorization check, but rather the complete absence of one. The CWE classification guidance emphasizes the distinction between missing authentication (CWE-306) and missing authorization after authentication (CWE-862). Since there is no authentication required, CWE-306 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-306 is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1953.99\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1928.80\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1924.98\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1909.20\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1830.14\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.91\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.90\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.90\n\n## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.87\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.87\n\n## CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.73\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.68\n\n## CWE-499: Serializable Class Containing Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.68",
