  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1217 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content from github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-v8xr-gpvj-cx9g **is directly related to CVE-2025-1217**. The CVE ID is explicitly mentioned in the advisory. The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe header parser of the `http` stream wrapper does not handle folded headers correctly. It treats newlines within a header as header separators instead of recognizing them as continuations of the previous header.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incorrect parsing of HTTP headers, specifically folded headers.\n*   Failure to adhere to RFC9112#5.2 regarding handling of `obs-fold` in HTTP responses.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Incorrect MIME type reporting via `STREAM_NOTIFY_MIME_TYPE_IS` notification.\n*   Misparsing of the HTTP response, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of headers, especially in scenarios involving redirects.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nA malicious server can send HTTP responses with folded headers.  The provided PoC demonstrates this using `netcat` to serve a crafted HTTP response.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP response sent to the PHP application using the `http` stream wrapper. This could be a malicious web server or a man-in-the-middle position.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade PHP to version 8.1.32 or later.\n*   Upgrade PHP to version 8.2.28 or later.\n*   Upgrade PHP to version 8.3.18 or later.\n*   Upgrade PHP to version 8.4.5 or later.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.\n*   The advisory includes a detailed explanation of the issue and its consequences.\n*   The advisory credits TimWolla as the reporter of the vulnerability.\n*   The advisory references the relevant RFC (RFC9112) for proper header parsing.\n\nThe content from security.netapp.com is unrelated and does not provide any useful information.",

This can potentially lead to further vulnerabilities depending on how the misinterpretation is exploited.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-444 because the **incorrect parsing** is the root cause. The advisory states that the header parser of the `http` stream wrapper does not handle folded headers correctly. It treats newlines within a header as header separators instead of recognizing them as continuations of the previous header. This leads to an **inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests/responses**.\n\nCWE-113 is a secondary consideration because the **incorrect parsing** could potentially involve CRLF sequences. However, the primary issue is the inconsistent interpretation, not the direct injection of CRLF sequences.\n\nThe choice of CWE-444 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the advisory, which both highlight the incorrect parsing of HTTP headers as the root cause. The relationships between CWEs and the mapping guidance support this choice, as CWE-444 is a more specific and relevant classification than the other candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
