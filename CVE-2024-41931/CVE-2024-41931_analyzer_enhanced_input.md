## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin, including CVE-2024-41931.

**CVE-2024-41931**

*   **Root Cause:** The encryption key name is sent unencrypted when the key is broadcasted over RF.
*   **Weakness:** Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201).
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain access to the unencrypted key name which can reveal sensitive information about the encryption in use.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker within RF range can capture the broadcasted message.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with the ability to capture RF signals in the vicinity of the device and knowledge of the plugin's communication protocols is required. Physical access to the device or the device's network is not required.

The document also provides the following details which are not explicitly stated in the standard CVE description:

*   **Affected Product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.
*   **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 4.3 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
*   **CVSS v4 Score:** 5.3 (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
*   **Mitigation:** Sharing the encryption key via a local QR code is advised for higher security, and users are encouraged to update to v2.0.7 or greater.

The document also provides mitigations for all vulnerabilities:
*   Use discreet callsigns and key names.
*   Secure end-user devices with encryption and regular updates.
*   Follow key rotation best practices.
*   Use QR codes for secure key exchange.
*   Secure broadcasting environments by transmitting keys at reduced power.
*   Leverage layered encryption for communications.
