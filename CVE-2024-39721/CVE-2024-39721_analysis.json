This is directly related to the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the application **allocates resources** (goroutine) based on **user-controlled input** without proper validation, eventually leading to **resource exhaustion**. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which describes the high-level impact of the vulnerability. CWE-20 is also related since the **user-controlled input** isn't validated.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of input validation** (CWE-20) on the `req.Path` parameter, which allows a user to specify `/dev/random` as the file to be opened. The application then **allocates a resource** (goroutine) to read this file without any limits or throttling (CWE-770). Since `/dev/random` is a blocking device, the goroutine gets stuck in an infinite loop, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and a denial-of-service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The description clearly states that the user-controlled `req.Path` parameter can be set to `/dev/random`, which causes a goroutine to run infinitely. This behavior aligns directly with CWE-770, \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\", as the application allocates a goroutine without limiting the time.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the decision to include CWE-400, as it represents the broader impact of the vulnerability. CWE-20 was added to represent the missing input validation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-770 captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE
