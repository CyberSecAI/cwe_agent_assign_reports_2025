### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** projectworlds Online Time Table Generator
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /admin/add_course.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/add_course.php` file of the "Online Time Table Generator PHP MYSQL V1.0" project.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient user input validation of the 'c' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. The attacker injects malicious code from the parameter 'c' and uses it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.
*   **Attack vectors:** Injecting malicious SQL queries through the 'c' parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/admin/add_course.php` file and inject malicious SQL code into the 'c' parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
    *   Input validation and filtering.
    *   Minimize database user permissions.
    *   Regular security audits.
