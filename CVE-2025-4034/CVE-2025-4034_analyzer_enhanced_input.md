## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4034 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2025-4034, it details a vulnerability that could be assigned that ID (or a similar one). The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'Doc\_ID' parameter in the `/inser_doc_process.php` file. Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'Doc\_ID' POST parameter in `/inser_doc_process.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/inser_doc_process.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples (from the content):**

*   **boolean-based blind:** `Doc_ID=1' AND 1508=1508 AND 'TVRf'='TVRf&Doc_fname=1&Doc_mname=1&Doc_lname=1&Doc_gender=1&Doc_DOB=1111-01-01&Doc_contactno=1&Doc_emailID=1406213367@qq.com&Doc_Address=1&Doc_Specialist=1&Doc_DeptID=1&Doc_charge=1&save=submit`
*   **error-based:** `Doc_ID=1' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x716a707071,(SELECT (ELT(1452=1452,1))),0x71767a7671),1452) AND 'QpsH'='QpsH&Doc_fname=1&Doc_mname=1&Doc_lname=1&Doc_gender=1&Doc_DOB=1111-01-01&Doc_contactno=1&Doc_emailID=1406213367@qq.com&Doc_Address=1&Doc_Specialist=1&Doc_DeptID=1&Doc_charge=1&save=submit`
*   **time-based blind:** `Doc_ID=1' AND (SELECT 1076 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ZtUE) AND 'pqjH'='pqjH&Doc_fname=1&Doc_mname=1&Doc_lname=1&Doc_gender=1&Doc_DOB=1111-01-01&Doc_contactno=1&Doc_emailID=1406213367@qq.com&Doc_Address=1&Doc_Specialist=1&Doc_DeptID=1&Doc_charge=1&save=submit`
