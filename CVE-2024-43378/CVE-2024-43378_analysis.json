  "description": "calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI some disk partitions are encrypted but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 200659 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 090020 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-43378:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from a regression in how `calamares-nixos-extensions` handles LUKS keyfile creation during manual disk partitioning on systems using legacy BIOS. Specifically, the keyfile was not correctly placed or protected when `/boot` or `/` were unencrypted.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Plaintext Keyfile Exposure:** The LUKS keyfile, intended to decrypt encrypted partitions, was stored in plaintext.  This either occurred in `/crypto_keyfile.bin` or within a CPIO archive attached to the initrd.\n- **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** The logic for determining when to create the `crypto_keyfile.bin` was flawed, particularly in cases of manual partitioning with specific combinations of encrypted/unencrypted `/` and `/boot` partitions on legacy BIOS systems.\n- **Regression:** This was a regression of a previous vulnerability (CVE-2023-36476), which was more severe.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Complete Disk Compromise:**  An attacker who gains local access to the system can obtain the plaintext LUKS keyfile, which allows them to decrypt all encrypted partitions, thereby gaining access to all data.\n- **Data Breach:** This could lead to a data breach.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the system to retrieve the exposed keyfile.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to access the filesystem of the affected system.\n- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploitation.\n- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to retrieve the keyfile.\n- **Legacy BIOS Systems** The system has to be booted using Legacy BIOS and not UEFI.\n- **Manual Partitioning:** The user must have used manual partitioning during installation and created a specific configuration.\n    *   Some disk partitions are encrypted, while `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted.\n    *   The vulnerability **does not** affect default setups using automatic partitioning on legacy BIOS systems.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability was patched in `calamares-nixos-extensions` version 0.3.17.\n- The fix was included in NixOS through pull requests #331607 and #334252.\n- The NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels were affected until the fix was merged (2024-08-13 and 2024-08-15, respectively).\n- The provided content includes details on how to check for the vulnerability using `binwalk` and suggests remediation steps, however, a full reinstallation is the preferred method.\n\nThe content also references a previous vulnerability, CVE-2023-36476 (GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww), and its fix, which was a similar issue with the LUKS keyfile exposure.",

CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children. However, given the broad nature of the vulnerability and the fact that the keyfile was stored in plaintext, CWE-522 is a suitable high-level classification.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the issue of sensitive information (the LUKS key) not being removed before storage. However, CWE-522 is selected as the primary because it directly addresses the **weakness** of the credentials not being protected, while CWE-212 describes the implication of the credentials not being protected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    \n    cwe212 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** handling of LUKS keyfile creation during manual partitioning. This leads to the LUKS keyfile being stored in plaintext, which results in the exposure of sensitive credentials and potential data breach.\n\nRoot Cause: **Incorrect** handling of LUKS keyfile creation during manual partitioning.\nWeakness: LUKS keyfile stored in plaintext.\nImpact: Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential data breach.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) because the core issue is that the LUKS keyfile, which serves as a credential for decrypting the disk, was not adequately protected due to being stored in plaintext. This is supported by the \"Plaintext Keyfile Exposure\" point in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the keyfile was found in plaintext.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) was also considered as a secondary CWE because the **impact** of not protecting the credentials is that sensitive information was not removed before storage. However, CWE-522 is a better fit as it focuses on the core weakness of the credentials being insufficiently protected.\n\nThe choice of CWE-522 is at the Class level of abstraction, because the available information doesn't point to a specific method of credential protection that was violated, only that the credentials ended up stored as plaintext. This means there's insufficient evidence to select a more specific Base or Variant level CWE related to credential storage or transmission.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
