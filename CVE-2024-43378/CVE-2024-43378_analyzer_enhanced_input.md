## Vulnerability Description
calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI some disk partitions are encrypted but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 200659 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 090020 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unencrypted LUKS disk encryption key file
- **product:** calamares-nixos-extensions
- **version:** before 0.3.17

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-43378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a regression in how `calamares-nixos-extensions` handles LUKS keyfile creation during manual disk partitioning on systems using legacy BIOS. Specifically, the keyfile was not correctly placed or protected when `/boot` or `/` were unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Keyfile Exposure:** The LUKS keyfile, intended to decrypt encrypted partitions, was stored in plaintext.  This either occurred in `/crypto_keyfile.bin` or within a CPIO archive attached to the initrd.
- **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** The logic for determining when to create the `crypto_keyfile.bin` was flawed, particularly in cases of manual partitioning with specific combinations of encrypted/unencrypted `/` and `/boot` partitions on legacy BIOS systems.
- **Regression:** This was a regression of a previous vulnerability (CVE-2023-36476), which was more severe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete Disk Compromise:**  An attacker who gains local access to the system can obtain the plaintext LUKS keyfile, which allows them to decrypt all encrypted partitions, thereby gaining access to all data.
- **Data Breach:** This could lead to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the system to retrieve the exposed keyfile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to access the filesystem of the affected system.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploitation.
- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to retrieve the keyfile.
- **Legacy BIOS Systems** The system has to be booted using Legacy BIOS and not UEFI.
- **Manual Partitioning:** The user must have used manual partitioning during installation and created a specific configuration.
    *   Some disk partitions are encrypted, while `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted.
    *   The vulnerability **does not** affect default setups using automatic partitioning on legacy BIOS systems.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was patched in `calamares-nixos-extensions` version 0.3.17.
- The fix was included in NixOS through pull requests #331607 and #334252.
- The NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels were affected until the fix was merged (2024-08-13 and 2024-08-15, respectively).
- The provided content includes details on how to check for the vulnerability using `binwalk` and suggests remediation steps, however, a full reinstallation is the preferred method.

The content also references a previous vulnerability, CVE-2023-36476 (GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww), and its fix, which was a similar issue with the LUKS keyfile exposure.
