# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7413

## Vulnerability Description
The Obfuscate Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has **display_errors on**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `Obfuscate Email` plugin for WordPress exposing its `bootstrap.php` file directly. This file has `display_errors` enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path of the web application via the `bootstrap.php` file, due to `display_errors` being enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can retrieve the full server path of the WordPress installation. This information is considered sensitive.
- **Aid to Other Attacks:** While the path information itself is not directly damaging, it can be used by attackers to aid in further attacks. An attacker would need to identify another vulnerability to fully compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through direct access to the `bootstrap.php` file via a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
