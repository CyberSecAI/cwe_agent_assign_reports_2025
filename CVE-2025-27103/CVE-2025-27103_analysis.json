  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-27103: Dataease Mysql JDBC Connection Parameters Not Verified Leads to Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe JDBC connection string returned by the `getJdbc()` function is not URL decoded, allowing for bypass of parameter checks. Specifically, the code fails to properly decode URL-encoded characters in the `extraParams` string, enabling malicious parameters to be injected.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper input validation: The application does not properly validate the JDBC connection parameters, specifically failing to URL decode the `extraParams` string.\n*   Arbitrary file read: This vulnerability allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files on the server.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAuthenticated users can read and deserialize arbitrary files through the background JDBC connection.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  An attacker can craft a malicious JDBC connection string with URL-encoded parameters that bypass the parameter checks.\n2.  The attacker sends a request with the crafted JDBC string.\n3.  The application constructs the JDBC URL without proper decoding, allowing the malicious parameters to be included.\n4.  The attacker can then leverage the vulnerability to read arbitrary files.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker must be an authenticated user.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2.10.6 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `io.dataease.dto.datasource.MysqlConfiguration`.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by N1etzsche0 and coordinated by yulate and h3h3qaq.\n*   The vulnerability is related to a re-bypass for the patch for CVE-2024-55953.\n*   CWEs are not specified in the advisory.",

The root cause is the **improper input validation** where the JDBC connection string returned by the `getJdbc()` function is not URL decoded, allowing for bypass of parameter checks. This leads to **deserialization of untrusted data**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-502 (**Deserialization of Untrusted Data**). The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly state that the issue allows authenticated users to deserialize arbitrary files. The retriever results also list CWE-502 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) is considered as a secondary CWE since the root cause involves the application's failure to properly validate the JDBC connection parameters. However, CWE-502 is a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
