- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** f2fs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-47691.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the f2fs filesystem driver that can lead to a use-after-free. This occurs because the garbage collection thread (`gc_th`) can be freed while the `f2fs_do_shutdown` function is still trying to access it. Specifically, the `sbi->gc_th` pointer can become a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The `gc_th` pointer, after being freed, is accessed by another thread, resulting in memory corruption.
- Race condition: Concurrent operations involving remounting and filesystem shutdown can trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Kernel crash
- Memory corruption
- Potential for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by:
- Remounting the filesystem
- Performing a filesystem shutdown operation via `f2fs_ioc_shutdown`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to:
- Have the ability to mount and remount an f2fs filesystem.
- Have the ability to trigger a filesystem shutdown or remount operation.
- Have local user access to trigger the IOCTL commands
