This leads to an **out-of-bounds write** which results in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **stack overflow** caused by a crafted POST request to bsw_pppoe.cgi. The primary weakness is CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow, as it accurately describes the root cause. CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write is a potential consequence of the overflow, but less specific.
