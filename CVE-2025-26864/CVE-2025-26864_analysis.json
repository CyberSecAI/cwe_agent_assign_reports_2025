While both relate to sensitive information exposure, CWE-532 represents the specific case of logging sensitive information, making it a more precise root cause in this scenario. CWE-200 is more general and acts as a high level category that the vulnerability falls into. Because CWE-200 is a Class level and is discouraged, the more specific and Base level CWE-532 is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File** (CWE-532) which leads to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200). The root cause is logging sensitive information, which results in unauthorized exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, both CWE-532 and CWE-200 seemed applicable based on the vulnerability description. However, the key phrase \"**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**\" strongly suggests that the sensitive information is being written to a log file, making CWE-532 the more direct and specific root cause. The \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\" (CWE-200) is the resulting impact of this **weakness**.\n\nThe relationship graph further supports this decision. CWE-532 is chosen as the primary CWE because it is a Base level CWE and is more specific. CWE-200 is considered but classified as a secondary candidate since it represents the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the vulnerability's nature. CWE-532 captures the specific flaw of logging sensitive information, while CWE-200 describes the general impact of sensitive information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
