  "description": "A **YAML deserialization** vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) dynparam, a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the set and get verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code.",

Deserialization vulnerabilities often result in the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code. CWE-502 is the root cause, and CWE-94 is a potential consequence. The abstraction levels are both Base, representing specific weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe502\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of yaml.load() function** which leads to **YAML deserialization**, and then the ability to **execute arbitrary Python code**.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data** due to use of `yaml.load()`\n  - **Impact:** CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** allowing arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe core issue is the **use of yaml.load() function** which is known to be unsafe and can lead to arbitrary code execution. The fix replaces `yaml.load` with `yaml.safe_load`.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data**. The use of `yaml.load()` without proper validation of the deserialized data allows an attacker to craft malicious YAML payloads that can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nCWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** is a secondary candidate because the impact of the vulnerability is the execution of arbitrary code. However, it is a consequence of the deserialization, not the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the root cause and the immediate impact of the vulnerability. CWE-502 accurately describes the **deserialization** issue, and CWE-94 describes the resulting **code injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
