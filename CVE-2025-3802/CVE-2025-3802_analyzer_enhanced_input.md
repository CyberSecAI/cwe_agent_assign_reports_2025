## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Tenda W12 and i24 3.0.0.4(2887)/3.0.0.5(3644). It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function cgiPingSet of the file /bin/httpd. The manipulation of the argument pingIP leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Tenda W12 and i24
- **version:** 3.0.0.4(2887)/3.0.0.5(3644)
- **component:** cgiPingSet function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack overflow in Tenda w12 and i24 routers. The vulnerability exists within the `cgiPingSet` function in the `/bin/httpd` program. The `pingIP` parameter is not length-limited, leading to the stack overflow.
*   **Affected Firmware:**
    *   w12 V3.0.0.5(3644)
    *   i24 V3.0.0.4(2887)
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pingIP` parameter in `cgiPingSet` lacks input validation, allowing for arbitrarily long input that overflows the stack.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The provided information does not detail the impact of a successful exploit.
*   **Attack vector:**  The content doesn't specify how to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The content doesn't specify required attacker capabilities.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide information about mitigation or fix.

**Additional detail than the CVE description**: This content provides the specific function (`cgiPingSet`) and parameter (`pingIP`) where the vulnerability exists. It also lists affected firmware versions and includes screenshots showing normal and overflow situations.
