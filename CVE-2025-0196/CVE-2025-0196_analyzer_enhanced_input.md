## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /user/plist.php. The manipulation of the argument cat leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument cat
- **product:** code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /user/plist.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `plist.php` file of a PHP-based Point of Sale (POS) inventory system.
- The `cat` parameter from the HTTP GET request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization on the `$cat` parameter allows for SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the parameter, which is then executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. This may include user credentials, product details, financial information, or other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Beyond reading data, SQL injection can potentially be used to modify, insert, or delete records in the database, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes in the system's state.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain access to the underlying operating system or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `plist.php` including the malicious SQL payload in the `cat` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **Basic understanding of web application parameters and HTTP methods:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP GET requests with custom parameters.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided PoC demonstrates a successful SQL injection using the payload `1' or 1=1-- -`. This payload bypasses the original query's `WHERE` clause, retrieving all records from the database.
- The vulnerable system is identified as "pos-inventory-system-in-php" from code-projects.org.
- The vulnerability was found in version 3 as specified in the title of the markdown file: `POS_sql_3.md`.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability's nature, impact, and how to exploit it.
