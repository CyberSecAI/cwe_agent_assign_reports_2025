The Spack upload endpoint can be leveraged for a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) write in combination with a race condition to achieve remote code execution via path loading manipulation, allowing an unauthenticated actor to achieve remote code execution (RCE).This issue is known to affect Concerto from 12.1.2 through 12.2.0. Additional versions may be vulnerable. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-367 CWE-288 CWE-290 CWE-285 CWE-941 CWE-362 CWE-294 CWE-502 CWE-306",
