# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-32078

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship to consider is that **CWE-79** is often a consequence of **CWE-116**. The **improper encoding or escaping** (**CWE-116**) can directly lead to the ability to inject scripts and cause cross-site scripting (**CWE-79**). While **CWE-116** is a Class, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Cross-Site Scripting**, and the retriever results strongly suggest **CWE-79**, making it the more specific and appropriate choice for the primary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**. Because output is not properly encoded or escaped, this leads to **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states "**Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output** vulnerability in The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - Version Compare Extension allows **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**." The key phrases also highlight "**Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**" as the root cause and "**Cross-Site Scripting, XSS**" as the weakness.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being displayed, leading to the injection of malicious JavaScript code (XSS).

Given this information, the primary CWE is **CWE-79**, which directly addresses the XSS vulnerability. **CWE-116** is a contributing factor, as improper encoding or escaping is a common cause of XSS, but **CWE-79** is a more precise description of the resulting vulnerability.

The retriever results also indicate **CWE-79** as the top candidate, with a score of 1.0, and **CWE-116** as a secondary candidate.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   **CWE-80:** While related to XSS, **CWE-79** is broader and more encompassing of the vulnerability described.
*   **CWE-352:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is not directly related to the described vulnerability.
*   **CWE-434:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type is not relevant to the vulnerability description.
*   **CWE-425:** Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is not directly related to the described vulnerability.

The selection of **CWE-79** and **CWE-116** is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. **CWE-79** is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the resulting Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. **CWE-116** is a relevant contributing factor.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
