The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. This aligns directly with the characteristics of CWE-319.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe319 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**. This leads directly to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, which can be intercepted by a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-319 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, which is the root cause. This directly leads to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is based on:\n- Direct evidence from the vulnerability description stating the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**.\n- The definition of CWE-319 perfectly matches the vulnerability: \"The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\"\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n- CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor: While this is an impact of the vulnerability, it is not the root cause. The root cause is the cleartext transmission.\n- CWE-614 Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute: This is a more specific case of cleartext transmission and is not applicable here as the vulnerability description doesn't specify cookies.\n- CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data: This is a more general case that includes data at rest, which is not the focus of this vulnerability.\n- CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: This is not applicable as the issue is not about the cryptographic algorithm itself, but the absence of encryption due to the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**.\n- CWE-300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint: This is related to the channel being accessed by unauthorized actors, but the root cause is the cleartext transmission of data rather than the channel access itself.",
