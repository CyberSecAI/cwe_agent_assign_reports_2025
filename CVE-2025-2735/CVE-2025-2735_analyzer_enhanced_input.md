## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/add-services.php' file of the 'Old Age Home Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'sertitle' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
* SQL injection

Impact of exploitation:
* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.

Attack vectors:
* The vulnerability can be exploited through the 'sertitle' parameter in a POST request to '/admin/add-services.php'.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability

Mitigation or fix:
* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regular security audits.
