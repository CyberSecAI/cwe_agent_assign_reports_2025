  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in HumanSignal label-studio-ml-backend up to 9fb7f4aa186612806af2becfb621f6ed8d9fdbaf and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function load of the file label-studio-ml-backend/label_studio_ml/examples/yolo/utils/neural_nets.py of the component PT File Handler. The manipulation of the argument path leads to **deserialization**. An attack has to be approached locally. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5173 Content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to a potential vulnerability. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `load` function uses `torch.load` to deserialize data from a specified path without validation. `torch.load` can execute arbitrary code when loading malicious pickle data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.** Specifically, using `torch.load` on untrusted data.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system running the code.\n*   Potential for stealing sensitive information, modifying system files, or launching denial-of-service attacks.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious `.pt` file (containing malicious pickle data).\n*   Trick the application into loading this malicious file using the vulnerable `load` function.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.pt` file to the application, influencing the `path` argument of the `load` function.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a mitigation or fix, but implies that validation of the data before deserialization with `torch.load` is necessary.",
