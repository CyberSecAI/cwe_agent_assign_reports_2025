CWE-79 is a parent of several variant CWEs, but the description does not provide enough detail to choose a more specific variant. CWE-1004 is weakly related because the XSS could lead to cookie compromise, but the primary issue is the XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe1004 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **XSS** (**CWE-79**) which leads to the compromise of the cookie policy and potential full session compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **XSS** as the primary weakness, which aligns directly with CWE-79. The retriever results also strongly support this mapping. The description focuses on the **XSS** aspect and its potential impact on cookie security. The lack of details regarding the specific type of **XSS** prevents selection of a more specific variant of CWE-79. CWE-1004 is a secondary consideration because the compromise of the cookie policy is a consequence of the **XSS**, not the primary **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security
