# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-12140

## Description

The Elementor Addons AI Addons 70 Widgets, Premium Templates, Ultimate Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 via the render function due to **insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft templates that they should not have access to.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included
- **Weakness:** Information Exposure
- **Impact:** extract data from private or draft templates
- **Vector:** render function
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **Product:** Elementor Addons AI Addons 70 Widgets, Premium Templates, Ultimate Elements plugin for WordPress

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class |  | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class |  | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE that can have more specific Base-level children. However, based on the provided information, there isn't sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific child CWE. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered as a potential secondary weakness due to the **information exposure** aspect, but is a high-level class and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included** leading to **information exposure**, allowing attackers to extract data from private or draft templates they shouldn't access.
  - **Root Cause:** **Insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included** (Incorrect Authorization)
  - **Weakness:** **Information Exposure** (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere)
  - **Impact:** Extract data from private or draft templates

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary candidate due to the **insufficient restrictions** on template inclusion, which is a form of authorization failure. This aligns with the vulnerability description mentioning that authenticated attackers can access data they should not have access to. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the vulnerability leads to **information exposure**.

The relationship graph indicates that CWE-863 can be a parent of more specific authorization-related CWEs. However, without more detailed information about the exact mechanism of the authorization failure, it's difficult to choose a more specific CWE.

The final decision to map CWE-863 is based on the evidence of **insufficient restrictions**, which directly relates to an authorization issue. While **information exposure** is a symptom, the root cause lies in the authorization **failure**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
