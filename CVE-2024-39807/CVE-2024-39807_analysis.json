The **failure to sanitize** the recipients of a webhook event leads to **insertion of sensitive information** into the sent data. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was that CWE-201 represents a **failure to sanitize** data which results in the insertion of sensitive information into the data being sent.\nThe retriever results pointed to several authorization-related CWEs, but the vulnerability description focuses on information leakage rather than authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Failure to properly sanitize the recipients of a webhook event**.\n2.  **Weakness:** Insertion of sensitive information (channel IDs of archived/restored channels) into the sent data.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker monitoring webhook events can retrieve the channel IDs of archived or restored channels.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is the **failure to sanitize** data before sending it, which results in sensitive information being leaked.\nThe vulnerability description states the application **fails to properly sanitize the recipients of a webhook event**. This directly aligns with CWE-201, which describes the insertion of sensitive information into sent data. The impact, retrieval of channel IDs, confirms that the inserted data is indeed sensitive.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, particularly those related to authorization, as the vulnerability involves access to channel IDs. However, the root cause is not a broken authorization scheme, but rather a **failure to sanitize** the webhook event recipients, leading to the inclusion of sensitive information. Therefore, CWE-201 is the most appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
