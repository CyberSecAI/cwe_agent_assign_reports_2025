  "description": "The Simple Restrict plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11106:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the Simple Restrict plugin's failure to properly restrict access to content when using the WordPress core search functionality. Although the plugin restricts content on the front end, it doesn't apply the same restrictions to search results.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Content Restriction:** The plugin enforces content restrictions on page views, but not when content is accessed through the WordPress search feature.\n*   **Lack of Authorization Checks in Search:** The search functionality does not check user permissions before displaying results, allowing unauthorized access to restricted content.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Unauthenticated attackers can bypass content restrictions and access sensitive information from restricted pages by using the search function. This could include data intended only for administrators or specific user roles.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **WordPress Search Feature:** The primary attack vector is the built-in WordPress search functionality. Attackers can craft search queries to locate restricted content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. They can perform the attack from any location with access to the site's search function.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in Simple Restrict plugin versions 1.2.7 and earlier.\n*   The fix implemented in version 1.2.8 addresses the lack of permission checks within the search functionality.\n*   The `posts_args_search` function in `/public/class-simple-restrict-public.php` was introduced or modified to address the issue. This function modifies the query to exclude restricted pages.\n* The `get_all_restricted_pages` function was also introduced in version 1.2.8. This function is used to get all the restricted pages, based on the permissions set.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided changelog highlights \"Fixed: Security Issue\" in versions 1.2.7 and 1.2.8, confirming the identified vulnerability was addressed.\n*   The Wordfence article indicates this vulnerability is classified as a \"Sensitive Information Exposure\" issue.\n* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).\n* The fix was to modify the search query to exclude pages that the user does not have permissions to see.",

A secondary contributing factor is **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to this exposure. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE and represents a broader category of authorization issues, making CWE-200 a more specific and relevant classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200\n    cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862) in the WordPress core search feature, allowing **unauthenticated attackers** to **extract sensitive data** from posts that should have been restricted, leading to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Sensitive Information Exposure (CWE-200)** because the vulnerability's description explicitly states that \"unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-200: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\" A contributing factor is **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** because the WordPress plugin lacks proper authorization checks within the core search feature, which results in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and keyphrase analysis. The graph relationships confirm that **missing authorization** can lead to **sensitive information exposure**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-200 accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability, and CWE-862 explains the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-

A secondary contributing factor is **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to this exposure. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE and represents a broader category of authorization issues, making CWE-200 a more specific and relevant classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200\n    cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862) in the WordPress core search feature, allowing **unauthenticated attackers** to **extract sensitive data** from posts that should have been restricted, leading to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Sensitive Information Exposure (CWE-200)** because the vulnerability's description explicitly states that \"unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-200: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\" A contributing factor is **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** because the WordPress plugin lacks proper authorization checks within the core search feature, which results in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and keyphrase analysis. The graph relationships confirm that **missing authorization** can lead to **sensitive information exposure**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-200 accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability, and CWE-862 explains the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
