CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-862 and CWE-863 are also Class-level CWEs and children of CWE-285. The choice of CWE-285 as the primary CWE is due to its higher-level nature, reflecting the general **improper authorization** issue described in the vulnerability. However, CWE-863 and CWE-862 are considered as secondary candidates because they offer more specific authorization flaws.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285), leading to a security feature bypass and a minor integrity change. The root cause is the **improper authorization**, which allows a low-privileged attacker to perform unauthorized actions.\n  - CWE-285: Improper Authorization (Root Cause)\n  - Impact: Security feature bypass and integrity change\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Authorization** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The final decision to map the vulnerability to CWE-285 is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions **Improper Authorization** as the root cause. The retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-285 being a relevant candidate.\n\nThe choice of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the general authorization issue without focusing on specific implementation details. While CWE-863 and CWE-862 are more specific, the provided evidence doesn't give enough information to choose between them.

CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-862 and CWE-863 are also Class-level CWEs and children of CWE-285. The choice of CWE-285 as the primary CWE is due to its higher-level nature, reflecting the general **improper authorization** issue described in the vulnerability. However, CWE-863 and CWE-862 are considered as secondary candidates because they offer more specific authorization flaws.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285), leading to a security feature bypass and a minor integrity change. The root cause is the **improper authorization**, which allows a low-privileged attacker to perform unauthorized actions.\n  - CWE-285: Improper Authorization (Root Cause)\n  - Impact: Security feature bypass and integrity change\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Authorization** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The final decision to map the vulnerability to CWE-285 is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions **Improper Authorization** as the root cause. The retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-285 being a relevant candidate.\n\nThe choice of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the general authorization issue without focusing on specific implementation details.
