# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44334

## Vulnerability Description
D-Link DI-7003GV2 v24.04.18D1, DI-7100G+V2 v24.04.18D1, DI-7100GV2 v24.04.18D1, DI-7200GV2 v24.04.18E1, DI-7300G+V2 v24.04.18D1, and DI-7400G+V2 v24.04.18D1 are vulnerable to Remote Command Execution due to **insufficient parameter filtering** in the CGI handling function of upgrade_filter.asp.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient parameter filtering**
- **impact:** Remote Command Execution
- **product:** D-Link DI-7003GV2 and DI-7100G+V2 and DI-7100GV2 and DI-7200GV2 and DI-7300G+V2 and DI-7400G+V2
- **version:** v24.04.18D1, v24.04.18E1
- **component:** CGI handling function of upgrade_filter.asp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-44334

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient filtering of external parameters in the CGI handling functions of the `upgrade_filter.asp` request handler within the `jhttpd` binary. Specifically, the `path` parameter is not adequately sanitized before being passed to the `system` function for execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The `commandInjectionCheck` function fails to properly filter malicious characters, permitting crafted payloads to bypass the validation and reach the `system` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain remote command execution with the highest privileges on the affected D-Link router.
- **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands means an attacker could potentially take complete control of the device, including access to the firmware system and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/version_upgrade.asp` endpoint.
- **`path` parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `path` parameter within the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the provided exploit code performs a login, indicating that authentication may be required prior to exploitation or that a valid session is needed.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable `upgrade_filter.asp` endpoint and the vulnerable parameter `path`.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) exploit written in Python that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability, using the Metasploit framework to deliver a reverse shell payload and execute commands on the router.
- The exploit includes:
    - Metasploit payload generation.
    - Starting a local HTTP server.
    - Authenticating to the router's web interface.
    - Sending malicious requests with the crafted command through the `path` parameter of `/version_upgrade.asp`.
- The content lists specific affected D-Link router models and firmware versions.

This content provides significant detail regarding the root cause, attack vector, and impact of CVE-2024-44334, including a functional exploit.
