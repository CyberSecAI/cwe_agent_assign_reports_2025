It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its resolution, and related discussions.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the `HTMLTags` extension returning the literal contents of the system message \"htmltags-notagname\", and the return value being interpreted as raw HTML. This allows for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nThe impact is not explicitly detailed beyond the potential for XSS, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nThe attack vector involves manipulating the system message \"htmltags-notagname\" to include malicious HTML/JavaScript code.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\nThe content doesn\\'t specify the exact privileges needed to manipulate the system message.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability was fixed with the following Gerrit change: [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/HTMLTags/+/1121056](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/HTMLTags/%2B/1121056)\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   The task was initially created by BlankEclair on February 13, 2025.\\n*   Yaron Koren was assigned to resolve the issue.\\n*   The issue was closed as resolved on February 19, 2025.\\n*   The task is associated with the MediaWiki extension \"HTMLTags\".\\n*   There were discussions about creating a dedicated project tag for the extension to facilitate issue tracking.\\n*   The task is linked to T382326, a task related to release announcements for security patches.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'version:1.39 through 1.43', 'keyphrase': '1.39 through 1.43', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(230.37052117894163)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - HTML Tags', 'keyphrase': 'Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - HTML Tags', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:1.39 through 1.43', 'keyphrase': '1.39 through 1.43', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(218.07377227650656)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
