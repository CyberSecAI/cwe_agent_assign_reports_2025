# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20490

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because HTTP proxy credentials could be recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view HTTP proxy server admin credentials in clear text that are configured on Nexus Dashboard to reach an external network. Note Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** view sensitive information
- **vector:** access tech support file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator
- **component:** logging function
