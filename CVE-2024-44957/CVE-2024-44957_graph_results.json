  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xen privcmd Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds irqfd_wakeup() gets EPOLLHUP, when it is called by eventfd_release() by way of wake_up_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLHUP), which gets called under spin_lock_irqsave(). We cant use a mutex here as it will lead to a deadlock. Fix it by switching over to a spin lock.",
