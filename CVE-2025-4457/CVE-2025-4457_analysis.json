Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n        2.  Conduct input validation and filtering.\n        3.  Minimize database user permissions.\n    *   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected file, version, payload, and suggested repair methods. It also includes a proof-of-concept (POC).",
