CWE-918 (SSRF) is the root cause that leads to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) being exploited. The abstraction levels were considered to choose the most specific CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe918 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, which is the root cause. A low-privileged user can exploit this SSRF vulnerability. This SSRF is then chained with an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability (which is best described as **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**) to escalate privileges to Admin. Thus, the **SSRF** enables the **Incorrect Authorization** to be exploited.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-918** as the primary weakness due to the **SSRF** vulnerability. The description explicitly states an **SSRF** vulnerability exists, which is the enabler. This is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which lists **SSRF** as a weakness.\n> \"an authenticated **SSRF** vulnerability in Wug.UI.Areas.Wug.Controllers.SessionControler.Update\"\n\nThe analysis also recognized that the **SSRF** is chained with an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability to escalate privileges.
