  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-5147 - PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content details a command injection vulnerability in Netcore routers (NBR1005GPE, B6, and NBR200). Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the `url` parameter in the `tools_ping` function. The `system()` function is called with a string constructed using user-provided input without sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Command Injection (specifically, a lack of input validation leading to arbitrary command execution).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote code execution on the router. The proof of concept demonstrates establishing a reverse shell.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/ubus` endpoint of the vulnerable router.\n*   Specifically, the request needs to be formatted as a JSON payload targeting the `network_tools` service and the `tools_ping` method, with a malicious command injected into the `url` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the vulnerable router.\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n*   Understanding of the router's API and the `ubus` protocol.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement input validation and sanitization for the `url` parameter in the `tools_ping` function to prevent the injection of arbitrary commands. The report suggests checking for character legitimacy.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Products:** NBR1005GPEV2, B6V2, NBR200V2\n*   **Firmware Download Links:** Provided for the affected products.\n*   **Technical Details:** The report provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code, including specific function calls (`sub_401EB8`, `tools_ping`) and the construction of the command string.\n*   **POC:** A detailed proof-of-concept (POC) is included, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability with example HTTP requests.\n*   **Architecture:** The firmware uses `uhttpd` + `ubus` architecture.\n*   **Discoverer:** Exploo0Osion.",

Since the **command injection** occurs specifically within the context of an operating system command, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice.

The `system()` function is called with a string constructed using user-provided input without sanitization. The primary CWE is CWE-78, which accurately describes the **improper neutralization of special elements in an OS command**. This is based on the vulnerability description, the CVE reference links content summary, and the retriever results.\n\nThe CWE-77 was considered but not used because CWE-78 is more specific, as the **command injection** occurs within the context of an OS command. The CWE-89 was considered but not used because the injection is not in an SQL command. CWE-79 was considered but not used because the injection is not during web page generation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
