# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-0115

## Vulnerability Description
NVIDIA CV-CUDA for Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and Jetpack contains a vulnerability in Python APIs where a user may cause an **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue by a long running CV-CUDA Python process. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service and data loss.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **uncontrolled resource consumption**
- **impact:** data loss and denial of service and resource consumption
- **vector:** long running CV-CUDA Python process
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** NVIDIA CV-CUDA
- **component:** Python APIs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-0115:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Python APIs of NVIDIA CV-CUDA, where a user can initiate a long-running process that consumes resources uncontrollably.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The core weakness is the lack of proper resource management in the Python APIs, allowing a user to exhaust resources by running a process indefinitely.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause a denial of service, potentially rendering the system or application unusable.
    *   Data Loss: The uncontrolled resource consumption might lead to data loss due to system instability or inability to save data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local Access (AV:L): The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the affected software is running.
    *   Low Complexity (AC:L): Exploiting the vulnerability is not complex.
    *   Low Privileges (PR:L): The attacker only requires low privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   No User Interaction (UI:N): No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the vulnerable system.
    *   Ability to execute Python scripts on the system.
    *   Low-level privileges on the system.

The document also specifies that the affected versions of NVIDIA CV-CUDA are v0.1.x through v0.9.x and that the fix is provided in version v0.10.0. The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and Jetpack.

Additionally, the document mentions that NVIDIA thanks ByteDance for reporting the vulnerability.
