  "description": "NVIDIA CV-CUDA for Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and Jetpack contains a vulnerability in Python APIs where a user may cause an **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue by a long running CV-CUDA Python process. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service and data loss.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-0115:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Python APIs of NVIDIA CV-CUDA, where a user can initiate a long-running process that consumes resources uncontrollably.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n    *   Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The core weakness is the lack of proper resource management in the Python APIs, allowing a user to exhaust resources by running a process indefinitely.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   Denial of Service (DoS): By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause a denial of service, potentially rendering the system or application unusable.\n    *   Data Loss: The uncontrolled resource consumption might lead to data loss due to system instability or inability to save data.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   Local Access (AV:L): The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the affected software is running.\n    *   Low Complexity (AC:L): Exploiting the vulnerability is not complex.\n    *   Low Privileges (PR:L): The attacker only requires low privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability.\n    *   No User Interaction (UI:N): No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   Local access to the vulnerable system.\n    *   Ability to execute Python scripts on the system.\n    *   Low-level privileges on the system.\n\nThe document also specifies that the affected versions of NVIDIA CV-CUDA are v0.1.x through v0.9.x and that the fix is provided in version v0.10.0. The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and Jetpack.\n\nAdditionally, the document mentions that NVIDIA thanks ByteDance for reporting the vulnerability.",

CWE-400 is a class-level CWE, and CWE-770 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400. I chose CWE-400 as the primary because the description states \"**uncontrolled resource consumption** issue\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper resource management, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption, and finally resulting in denial of service and data loss.\n- Root Cause: Improper resource management in Python APIs.\n- Weakness: **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400).\n- Impact: Denial of Service, Data Loss.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-400 seemed like the most appropriate choice due to the \"**uncontrolled resource consumption**\" mentioned in the vulnerability description and key phrases. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by explicitly stating \"**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400): The core weakness is the lack of proper resource management in the Python APIs, allowing a user to exhaust resources by running a process indefinitely.\"\n\nHowever, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the Retriever Results also suggest CWE-770 \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\", which is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400.\n\nI am keeping CWE-400 as the primary because it reflects the core weakness explicitly stated in the description. I am including CWE-770 as a secondary candidate because it represents a more specific manifestation of the problem (allocation without limits), but the overall issue is still best captured by the broader \"uncontrolled resource consumption\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
