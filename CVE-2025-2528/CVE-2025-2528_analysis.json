The application performs an authorization check, but the check is performed incorrectly. |\n| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.3 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary. Considered but less likely. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical relationship. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). Since the vulnerability involves an incorrect authorization check, CWE-863 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper authorization** (CWE-863) in the application password policy.\n2.  **Impact:** An authenticated user can use a configuration different from the one mandated by system administrators.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper authorization in application password policy**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause is \"**Improper authorization**\". The retriever results also list CWE-863 as a possible match.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), was selected because the application performs an authorization check related to the password policy, but the check is done incorrectly, allowing users to bypass the intended policy. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that the user is authenticated. The issue arises after authentication, during the authorization process.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate because it accurately represents the **incorrect authorization** issue. While a more specific base-level CWE might exist, the available information does not provide enough detail to narrow it down further.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
