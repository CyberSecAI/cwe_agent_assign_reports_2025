# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21947

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix **type confusion** via **race condition** when using ipc_msg_send_request req->handle is allocated using ksmbd_acquire_id(&ipc_ida), based on ida_alloc. req->handle from ksmbd_ipc_login_request and FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE ioctl can be same and it could lead to **type confusion** between messages, resulting in access to unexpected parts of memory after an incorrect delivery. ksmbd check type of ipc response but missing add continue to check next ipc reponse.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 419.17)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 408.59)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 4. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 355.49)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 5. CWE-662: Improper Synchronization (Score: 341.76)

The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes....

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 408.59)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 3. CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') (Score: 397.92)

The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type....

### 4. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 397.21)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 5. CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index (Score: 372.00)

The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array....

## IMPACT: 'access to unexpected parts of memory'

Relevant CWEs for this IMPACT:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 419.17)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 4. CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (Score: 141.47)

The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor....
