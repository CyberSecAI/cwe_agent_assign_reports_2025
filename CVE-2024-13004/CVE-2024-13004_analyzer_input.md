## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1.  Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-13004 (PLACEHOLDER - based on the context of the provided files)
*   **Affected Product:** Phpgurukul Complaint Management System
*   **Affected Version:** V1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/category.php`
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**2. Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `state` parameter within the `/admin/category.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the parameter, which is then directly used in database queries without sanitization.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries, leading to a classic SQL injection vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain full control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers can cause disruption or downtime of the service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `state` parameter in the `/admin/category.php` file. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is directly incorporated into SQL queries without sanitization.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. This means that it is exploitable by anyone with access to the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/category.php` and manipulate the `state` parameter.

**7. Proof of Concept (PoC):**
   *   The report mentions using the `sqlmap` tool to demonstrate the vulnerability. It also shows an example payload using `SLEEP()` to perform a time-based blind injection:
    ```
        Parameter: deo_user_name (POST)
        Type: time-based blind
        Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
        Payload: deo_user_name=deo" AND (SELECT 4695 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))bkhc)-- EKUz&deo_password=password&deo_id=1&action=Edit
    ```
   *   Although this specific payload targets `deo_action.php`, the report clearly states that the vulnerable file is `/admin/category.php`, and that the vulnerability is related to the `state` parameter.

**8. Suggested Repair:**
*   The report suggests using prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-provided input data, input validation and filtering and minimal database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits are recommended to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities

**Summary:**

The content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Phpgurukul Complaint Management System V1.0. The vulnerability resides in the `/admin/category.php` file, where the `state` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and service disruption. The report includes a PoC using sqlmap, and provides suggestions for fixing the vulnerability.
