  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix inode number range checks Patch series nilfs2 fix potential issues related to reserved inodes. This series fixes one **use-after-free** issue reported by syzbot, caused by nilfs2s internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value. This patch (of 3) In the current implementation of nilfs2, nilfs->ns_first_ino, which gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock, but its lower limit is not checked. As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly. In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in the C specification, so if ns_first_ino is set to a large value other than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially malfunction depending on the environment. Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of nilfs->ns_first_ino and by preventing bit shift",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper validation for the `ns_first_ino` value read from the superblock in the NILFS2 filesystem. Specifically, the code does not check if this value, which represents the first non-reserved inode number, is within a valid range.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n1.  **Insufficient Lower Bound Check:** The code does not ensure that `ns_first_ino` is greater than or equal to `NILFS_USER_INO`. This allows for the possibility of `ns_first_ino` overlapping with reserved inode numbers.\n2.  **Incorrect Inode Number Tests:** The macros `NILFS_MDT_INODE` and `NILFS_VALID_INODE` rely on the `ns_first_ino` value for their calculations. If `ns_first_ino` is set to a value less than `NILFS_USER_INO`, these macros will not function correctly.\n3.  **Undefined Bit Shift Behavior:** The `BIT` macro performs left bit-shift operations using the inode number as a shift count. When the shift count exceeds the bit width of an integer, the behavior is undefined in the C specification and may result in unexpected behavior. This can occur if `ns_first_ino` is set to a large value.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Inode Number Handling:** If a crafted or corrupted filesystem sets `ns_first_ino` to a low value (overlapping with reserved inodes), the inode number test macros will misidentify inodes, potentially leading to file system corruption, data loss, and other undefined behavior.\n*   **Potential Use-After-Free:**  The description mentions a use-after-free issue reported by syzbot. This is not directly addressed by the provided patch, but the root cause of the use-after-free is related to the incorrect inode handling.\n*   **System Instability**: Malfunctioning inode tests can lead to a variety of unpredictable issues and potentially crash the kernel.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Corrupted Filesystem:**  An attacker can create a corrupted NILFS2 filesystem image that includes a malicious value for `s_first_ino` in the superblock.\n*   **Malicious Filesystem Creation:** An attacker with sufficient privileges could create and mount a malicious NILFS2 filesystem with the intention of triggering a vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Filesystem Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create or manipulate a NILFS2 filesystem image and have the ability to mount this filesystem.\n*   **System Access:** To trigger the vulnerability, the attacker needs to mount the crafted filesystem on a vulnerable Linux system running the NILFS2 driver.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nThe provided patches address the issue by:\n* Adding a check to ensure `nilfs->ns_first_ino` is not less than `NILFS_USER_INO`, returning an error (`-EINVAL`) if the check fails.\n*  Modifying `NILFS_MDT_INODE` and `NILFS_VALID_INODE` macros to use `NILFS_USER_INO` as the lower bound rather than `NILFS_FIRST_INO(sb)` to prevent bitshifts equal or greater than `NILFS_USER_INO`.\n* Changing the type of `ns_first_ino` from a signed integer to an unsigned integer, which eliminates the need for type casting.\n\nThis fix prevents the issues caused by invalid values for `ns_first_ino` loaded from the superblock.",

If this number is invalid, it can lead to an **incorrect bitwise shift** (CWE-1335) during inode number tests. This can then lead to a **use-after-free** (CWE-416) condition if an internal inode is exposed in the namespace on a corrupted filesystem. Ultimately, this triggers an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) when the system attempts to access memory outside the intended buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified multiple potential CWEs based on the key phrases provided in the vulnerability description. The primary focus was on **use-after-free**, **improper input validation**, integer overflow/wraparound, and incorrect bitwise shift of integer. After carefully considering the vulnerability details and the relationships between the key phrases, the primary CWE was determined to be CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the ultimate impact of the vulnerability is writing to memory outside the intended buffer. CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), and CWE-1335 (Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer) are secondary CWEs that contribute to the vulnerability chain.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the vulnerability ultimately results in writing to memory outside of the intended buffer. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the issue is caused by nilfs2s internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted filesystem.\n\nThe secondary CWEs were selected based on their contribution to the vulnerability chain. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a result of the improper handling of the inode. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is due to the **lack of validation** of the first non-reserved inode number read from the superblock. CWE-1335 (Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer) is a result of using the invalid inode number in left bit-shift calculations.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. CWE-787 is a base-level CWE that directly describes the out-of-bounds write. CWE-416 is a base-level CWE that describes the use-after-free condition. CWE-1284 is a base-level CWE that describes the **improper validation** of the input. CWE-1335 is a base-level CWE that describes the incorrect bitwise shift of integer.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is relatively high (0.7) due to the clear evidence in the vulnerability description that supports the selected CWEs. The vulnerability description specifically mentions the **use-after-free** condition, the **lack of validation** of the inode number, and the out-of-bounds write.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): While the vulnerability description mentions bit-shift calculations and the possibility of exceeding the bit width of an integer, the primary issue is not an integer overflow or wraparound but rather the use of an invalid inode number in the calculation.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): The primary impact of the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, not an out-of-bounds read.\n*   CWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime): This CWE is not directly related to the vulnerability. The **use-after-free** condition is due to the improper handling of the inode, not the missing release of a file descriptor or handle.",
