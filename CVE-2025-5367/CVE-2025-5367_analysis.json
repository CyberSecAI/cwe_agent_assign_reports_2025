The key phrase \"sql injection\" confirms this.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-89 as the top hit with a score of 1.0 based on alternate_terms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-89, which represents the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to **SQL Injection**.
