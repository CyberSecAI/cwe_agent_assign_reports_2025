## Vulnerability Description
** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A **privilege escalation vulnerability** in CxUIUSvc64.exe and CxUIUSvc32.exe of Synaptics audio drivers allows a local authorized attacker to load a DLL in a privileged process. Out of an abundance of caution, this CVE ID is being assigned to better serve our customers and ensure all who are still running this product understand that the product is End-of-Life and should be removed. For more information on this, refer to the CVE Records reference information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** CxUIUSvc64.exe, CxUIUSvc32.exe
- **weakness:** **privilege escalation vulnerability**
- **product:** Synaptics audio drivers
- **impact:** load DLL, privilege escalation
- **attacker:** local authorized attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The CxUIUSvc service creates a named pipe without setting a security descriptor restricting access to the pipe, allowing any user to send data to the service.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Missing security descriptor on named pipe.
- Unrestricted DLL loading from user-supplied path.
- Elevation of Privileges

Impact of exploitation:
A carefully crafted message allows a DLL to be loaded into a process running at elevated privilege, resulting in an Elevation of Privileges vulnerability.

Attack vectors:
- Local authenticated attacker creates a pipe client and connects to the server end of the named pipe.
- The pipe client writes data containing the path to a malicious DLL to the pipe.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local authenticated attacker.

Mitigation or fix:
- Update to APO Driver 1.4.0.81 (or later).
- Affected driver packages should be updated to exclude CxUIUSvc64.exe or CxUIUSvc32.exe.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability affects products that have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported.
- Vulnerable driver families: 9.0.282.xxx, 9.0.285.xx, 9.0.278.xxx
- Vulnerable APO Driver: 1.4.0.80
- Updated APO Driver: 1.4.0.81

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privileges & Permissions

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
