  "description": "A hard-coded, non-random password for the object store (minio) of KNIME Business Hub in all versions except the ones listed below allows an unauthenticated remote attacker in possession of the password to read and manipulate swapped jobs or read and manipulate in- and output data of active jobs. It is also possible to cause a denial-of-service of most functionality of KNIME Business Hub by writing large amounts of data to the object store directly. There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub * 1.13.2 or later * 1.12.3 or later * 1.11.3 or later * 1.10.3 or later",

Directly reflects the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description and CVE details. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. While the primary issue is the hardcoded password, the impact reveals a lack of proper authentication mechanisms, making this relevant. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), which is a Variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). CWE-798 is, in turn, a parent of both CWE-259 and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). The relationship between CWE-259 and CWE-306 is more complex. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) can be a consequence of using hardcoded credentials, as the system might rely solely on these credentials for authentication, neglecting proper authentication mechanisms. This creates a chain where the hardcoded password (CWE-259) leads to missing authentication (CWE-306) and subsequent unauthorized access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe306 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded non-random password** (CWE-259). This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication, effectively resulting in **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (CWE-306). The attacker can then read and manipulate swapped jobs, read and manipulate in- and output data of active jobs, or cause a denial-of-service.\n\nCWE-259 (Root Cause) -> CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> Impact (Data Manipulation, DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **hard-coded password**, making CWE-259 the most appropriate primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly identifies \"A **hard-coded**, non-random password\" as the **root cause of the vulnerability**. The impact described in the vulnerability description aligns with the consequences of using a **hard-coded password**, further reinforcing this choice.\n\nCWE-306 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability enables an attacker to perform actions without proper authentication. This is a direct consequence of the **hard-coded password**, where the system essentially bypasses standard authentication procedures. The relationship analysis highlights this dependency.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. For example, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a higher-level class and doesn't capture the specific weakness of using a hardcoded password. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is similar but less accurate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a password.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-259 and CWE-306 offers the optimal level of specificity by addressing both the **root cause** (hardcoded password) and a significant consequence (missing authentication).",
