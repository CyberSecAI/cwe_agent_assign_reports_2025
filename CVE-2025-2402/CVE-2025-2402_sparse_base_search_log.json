It is also possible to cause a denial-of-service of most functionality of KNIME Business Hub by writing large amounts of data to the object store directly. There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub * 1.13.2 or later * 1.12.3 or later * 1.11.3 or later * 1.10.3 or later",
