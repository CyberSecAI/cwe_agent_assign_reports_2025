# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44076

## Vulnerability Description
In Microcks before 1.10.0, the POST /api/import and POST /api/export endpoints allow non-administrator access.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **non-admin access**
- **product:** Microcks
- **version:** before 1.10.0
- **component:** POST /api/import and POST /api/export endpoints

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks on the `/api/import` and `/api/export` endpoints. These endpoints, responsible for importing and exporting snapshots of the application's data, were accessible to unauthenticated users and users with manager roles, which should not have had access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authentication and authorization controls on the import/export endpoints.
*   **Insecure API Endpoints:** The `/api/import` and `/api/export` endpoints were not restricted to administrator roles as intended, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker, even without administrative privileges, could potentially export sensitive data or import malicious data, leading to data corruption or unauthorized disclosure.
*   **System Compromise:** Malicious imports could be used to inject harmful configurations or data into the system, potentially leading to a complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the API endpoints without any authentication.
*  **Low-Privilege User Access:** An attacker with a "manager" role could exploit the vulnerability because the endpoints weren't correctly restricted to "administrator" roles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Microcks instance to call the vulnerable API endpoints.
*   **No Authentication Required (in some cases):**  The vulnerability could be exploited without any authentication in the vulnerable version range.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported in the Microcks GitHub repository as issue #1212.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.10.0 of Microcks.
*  The fix includes enforcing that only users with the administrator role can access these endpoints.
* The vulnerable version range is 1.8.0 to 1.9.1.
