  "description": "The Contact Form by Bit Form Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the id parameter in versions 2.0 to 2.13.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.
