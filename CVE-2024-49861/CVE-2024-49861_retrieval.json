In check_func_arg() when the argument is as mentioned, the meta->raw_mode is never set. Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is read-only it succeeds. The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The latter indicates that its okay to pass a pointer to **uninitialized memory** as the memory is written to anyway. However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via * = val. The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*). MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know the b', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['BPF map being incorrectly annotated in the Linux kernel', 'uninitialized memory'], 'weakness': 'improper map annotation', 'impact': 'write into read-only maps', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'bpf'}, reference_content=\"### CVE-2024-49861\\n\\nBased on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from an oversight in the BPF verifier regarding how it handles writes to read-only BPF maps via specific helper functions. These helper functions, when used with arguments of type `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}`, could bypass the intended read-only restrictions of a map.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Incorrect Argument Type Handling:** The `check_func_arg()` function failed to set the `meta->raw_mode` flag when encountering `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` argument types. This flag is essential for indicating whether a memory region is uninitialized and subject to writes.\\n*   **Flawed Memory Access Checks:**  The `check_helper_mem_access()` function incorrectly assumed `BPF_READ` access for `PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE` base types when checking memory access, due to the missing `meta->raw_mode` flag, leading to successful validation even when the map was read-only.\\n*   **Bypass of Read-Only Restrictions:** The combination of the above weaknesses allowed BPF programs to write into BPF maps marked as read-only, violating memory safety and security invariants.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary Memory Modification:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious or compromised BPF program to modify the contents of read-only BPF maps, leading to arbitrary memory corruption.\\n*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating data structures within the kernel, this vulnerability could be leveraged for privilege escalation.\\n*   **Denial of Service:** Corrupting crucial kernel data structures can result in system instability and denial of service.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Malicious BPF Programs:** Attackers can craft malicious BPF programs to exploit this vulnerability.\\n*   **Compromised BPF Programs:** An attacker gaining control over an existing BPF program could exploit it.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Ability to load BPF programs:** An attacker needs the capability to load and execute BPF programs on the target system. This typically requires root privileges or specific capabilities that allow for BPF program loading.\\n*   **Understanding of BPF and the vulnerability:** The attacker needs a solid grasp of BPF internals and the specifics of the described vulnerability.\\n*   **Target system with vulnerable kernel:** The attacker needs to target a system running a kernel with the vulnerable code.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability affects specific helper functions that use `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` arguments when writing to memory, instead of reading from it.\\n*   The fix involves removing the special cases for `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` and reusing `ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM` with additional flags. `MEM_UNINIT` is used to indicate that the memory can be uninitialized, and `MEM_ALIGNED` ensures alignment for direct writes.\\n*   The change includes updating function prototypes within `include/linux/bpf.h`, `kernel/bpf/helpers.c`, `kernel/bpf/syscall.c`, `kernel/bpf/verifier.c`, `kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c`, and `net/core/filter.c`.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix helper writes to read-only maps Lonial found an issue that despite user- and BPF-side frozen BPF map (like in case of .rodata), it was still possible to write into it from a BPF program side through specific helpers having ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} as arguments. In check_func_arg() when the argument is as mentioned, the meta->raw_mode is never set. Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is read-only it succeeds. The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The latter indicates that its okay to pass a pointer to **uninitialized memory** as the memory is written to anyway. However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via * = val. The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*). MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know the b\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'BPF map being incorrectly annotated in the Linux kernel'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
