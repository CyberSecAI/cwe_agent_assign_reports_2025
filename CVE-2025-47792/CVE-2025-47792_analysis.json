In versions of Nextcloud Desktop prior to 3.15, 3rdparty applications already installed on a user machine can create link shares for almost all data via the socket API. These shares can then be easily sent off to an external service. Nextcloud Desktop fixes the issue in version 3.15. No known workarounds are available.",

While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might exist, the provided information doesn't give specifics on the exact mechanism of the access control failure that can be mapped to a lower level. CWE-639 is a potential secondary CWE due to the mention of key being user controlled, but it's not the main weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, allowing 3rd party apps to create link shares. This leads to the impact of the 3rd party applications being able to create link shares and send them to an external service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper access control** (CWE-284), which allows third-party applications to create link shares for almost all data via the socket API. The content from CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)\". This aligns with the vulnerability description, which indicates that 3rd party apps can create link shares for data they should not have access to. The abstraction level of CWE-284 (Class) is appropriate given the general nature of the weakness described. While there may be a more specific variant, the information provided does not contain enough detail. CWE-639 is considered as a secondary issue because the creation of the link share is done through the API.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
