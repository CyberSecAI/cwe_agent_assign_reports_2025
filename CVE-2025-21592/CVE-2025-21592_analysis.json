  "description": "An **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series devices allows a local, low-privileged user with access to the Junos CLI to view the contents of sensitive files on the file system. Through the execution of either show services advanced-anti-malware or show services security-intelligence command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system. This issue affects Junos OS SRX Series * All versions before 21.4R3-S8, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |\n| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.5 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200, which represents the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. It is a class-level CWE. CWE-269, Improper Privilege Management, is a related class-level CWE that could be considered, but it is more generic. The analysis focuses on the exposure aspect and whether the privilege management is the direct cause versus a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a low-privileged user executing a specific command in the Junos CLI. This command then leads to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200) by allowing the user to view the contents of sensitive files. The **Improper Privilege Management** (CWE-269) may be a contributing factor if the command should not have been accessible to a low-privileged user in the first place or if the files should have had more restrictive permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) as the primary weakness, aligning with the vulnerability description's key phrase. The description explicitly mentions the exposure of sensitive files to a low-privileged user.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-269 (**Improper Privilege Management**) which is a plausible root cause but less specific than CWE-200. While privilege management might be a contributing factor, the core issue is the unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence in the vulnerability description, emphasizing the \"Exposure of Sensitive Information.\" CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely captures the essence of the vulnerability - a low-privileged user gaining access to sensitive files. The relationship analysis indicates that while CWE-269 could be related, it is a more generic classification.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-200 is derived directly from the vulnerability description: \"allows a local, low-privileged user with access to the Junos CLI to view the contents of sensitive files on the file system.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
