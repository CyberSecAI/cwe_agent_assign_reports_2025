# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-21592
## Query
An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series devices allows a local, low-privileged user with access to the Junos CLI to view the contents of sensitive files on the file system. Through the execution of either show services advanced-anti-malware or show services security-intelligence command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system. This issue affects Junos OS SRX Series * All versions before 21.4R3-S8, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2.
