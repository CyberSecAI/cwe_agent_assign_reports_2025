## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function add_xp of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php. The manipulation of the argument job_company leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1
- **component:** add_xp of /_parse/_all_edits.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `job_company` parameter within the `add_xp` function of the job recruitment system. This allows for direct injection of user-supplied data into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The application directly incorporates the `job_company` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database. The provided example shows how an attacker can use SQL injection to enumerate databases.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Beyond information disclosure, a successful SQL injection could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, depending on the database permissions and privileges, a skilled attacker could potentially gain complete control of the database server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is initiated via an HTTP POST request to the `_parse/_all_edits.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter `job_company` is submitted within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server to send crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Understanding of HTTP:** An understanding of how to construct and send HTTP POST requests is required.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to know SQL syntax and how to craft SQL injection payloads to achieve their goals (e.g., information extraction, data modification).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided POC indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the `add_xp` function of the `_parse/_all_edits.php` file.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `job_company`, passed as a POST parameter.
*   The content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the exploitation of the vulnerability.
