  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in D-Link DNS-320 2.02b01. This affects an unknown part of the file /cgi-bin/discovery.cgi of the component Web Management Interface. The manipulation leads to information disclosure. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8461 (Note: The provided information does not directly reference this CVE ID, however, it describes a vulnerability related to D-Link DNS-320 which is likely related).\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue in the web management interface of the D-Link DNS-320 NAS device. Specifically, the `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint is vulnerable.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint leaks sensitive information.\n- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The vulnerable URL is not protected by any authentication or authorization mechanisms. This allows unauthorized access to the sensitive data.\n- **Hidden Interface:** The vulnerable endpoint is described as a \"hidden interface\", meaning it's not readily apparent or easily accessible through normal browsing, but is still accessible to an attacker.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information from the device by accessing the unprotected URL. This information could include device configuration details, usernames, passwords, or other potentially sensitive data. This data could then be used for further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a direct HTTP request to the vulnerable `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint.\n- **Remote exploitation:** As the web interface is typically accessible over a network, the attack can be performed remotely if the device is exposed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device. This could be achieved by being on the same local network or if the device is exposed to the internet.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Knowledge of the vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` to send the request.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The affected device, D-Link ShareCenter DNS-320, is listed as End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives updates. This means that the vulnerability will likely not be patched by the vendor. D-Link recommends that these devices be retired and replaced.\n- The provided information links to external resources such as GitHub, which contains more details on the vulnerability.\n\n**Summary**\nThe D-Link DNS-320 NAS device is vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw due to a lack of authentication/authorization on its `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint. This allows unauthorized attackers with network access to the device to obtain potentially sensitive information remotely without needing credentials.",

CWE-306 is related to CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) because **missing authentication** can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-306 is a base level CWE, providing a good level of specificity, and CWE-497 is also a base level CWE. The relationship between these is that a **missing authentication** is the cause and **information exposure** is the result.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe497\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306). Because there is no authentication, the system allows access to a resource. This leads directly to **information disclosure** (CWE-497), as an unauthorized attacker can now access sensitive system information.\n\nCWE-306 (Root Cause) -> CWE-497 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary issue is that there is **missing authentication** for the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi`. This allows unauthorized access, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is based on the evidence that the `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint lacks authentication, as mentioned in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"**Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The vulnerable URL is not protected by any authentication or authorization mechanisms. This allows unauthorized access to the sensitive data.\"\n\nCWE-497 is chosen as the secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to **information disclosure**, as also stated in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"**Information Disclosure:** The `/cgi-bin/discovery.cgi` endpoint leaks sensitive information.\"\n\nBoth CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to improper neutralization of input but rather to a **lack of authentication**.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to SQL injection.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n*   CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality): While the vulnerable endpoint is described as a \"hidden interface,\" the core issue is the **lack of authentication**, not the hidden nature of the functionality.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
