CWE-497 is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), which is a class-level CWE. The relationship analysis influenced the decision to choose CWE-267 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the ability to perform unsafe actions with certain privileges. CWE-497 is a secondary CWE because it describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe267 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions** (CWE-267). This leads to **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** (CWE-497). The root cause is that low-privileged users are able to access sensitive information due to **insufficient privilege checks**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the fact that low-privileged users were able to access sensitive information. The final conclusion is that the root cause is that a privilege is defined with unsafe actions, allowing low-privileged users to access sensitive information. This is based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the Splunk Secure Gateway App lacks proper access controls.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to choose CWE-267 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-497 is a secondary CWE because it describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and are at the base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
