The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, **Cross-site Scripting** (XSS), **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.', key_phrases={'rootcause':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    An **open redirect** vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, **Cross-site Scripting** (XSS), **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
