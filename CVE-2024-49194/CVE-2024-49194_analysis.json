  "description": "Databricks JDBC Driver before 2.6.40 could potentially allow remote code execution (RCE) by triggering a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter. The vulnerability is rooted in the **improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter**. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution in the context of the driver by tricking a victim into using a crafted connection URL that uses the property krbJAASFile.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `krbJAASFile` parameter within the Databricks JDBC Driver. This mishandling allows for a JNDI injection attack.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **JNDI Injection:** The driver is susceptible to JNDI injection via a specially crafted JDBC URL.\n- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The driver doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `krbJAASFile` parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can lead to remote code execution in the context of the driver.\n- **Arbitrary Deserialization:** The vulnerability can be used to trigger arbitrary deserialization through JNDI.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious JDBC URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious JDBC connection URL containing a specially crafted `krbJAASFile` parameter that triggers the JNDI injection.\n- **Victim Interaction:** A user must be tricked into using the malicious connection URL.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to Craft Malicious JDBC URL:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious JDBC URL containing the payload.\n- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a victim to use this malicious URL.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is rated with a high severity impact (CVSS 7.3).\n- The issue is fixed in Databricks JDBC Driver version 2.6.40 and above.\n- Mitigation steps for users who cannot update the driver include setting `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` and `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustSerialData` to false in their JVM configuration.",

CWE-917 is a more specific type of injection, making it a better fit for the vulnerability description.

This leads to a JNDI injection vulnerability, which can then be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE).\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter** (CWE-917).\n  - **Vulnerability:** JNDI Injection\n  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')), with a confidence score of 0.9. This is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter, due to the **improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the root cause is the **improper handling of the `krbJAASFile` parameter**, allowing for JNDI injection.\n\nCWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered but is too general. While the vulnerability is an injection, CWE-917 is more specific to expression language injection, which is the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) was also considered because JNDI injection often leads to deserialization issues. However, the primary issue is the injection itself, making CWE-917 the more accurate root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability (JNDI injection via a crafted connection URL), while remaining at the Base level of abstraction.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
