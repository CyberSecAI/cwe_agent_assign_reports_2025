  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-28200 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this analysis focuses on CVE-2025-28200 as described within the pwnit.io article.\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-28200. The article explicitly states:\n\n\"CVE-2025-28200 - Victure RX1800 EN_V1.0.0_r12_110933 was discovered to utilize a weak default password which includes the last 8 digits of the Mac address.\"\n\nThis aligns with the core issue identified in the analysis.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The router uses a predictable default password derived from the last 8 digits of the device's MAC address.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Weak default password.\n    *   Predictable password generation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's configuration and potentially compromise the network. The article details further vulnerabilities (RCE, UART access, SSH/Telnet enabling) that can be exploited *after* gaining initial access via the weak default password.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Attempting to log in with the default password (last 8 digits of the MAC address).\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Physical access to the router to obtain the MAC address.\n    *   Network access to the router.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   The article recommends replacing the router with a more reputable brand as there is no fix available.\n    *   Changing the default password immediately after setup (though the article notes this is difficult as root password cannot be changed via the UI).\n\n**3. Additional Details (More Detail than CVE Description):**\n\nThe article provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   A detailed account of the vulnerability discovery process, including attempts to contact the vendor.\n*   Information about other vulnerabilities found in the router (RCE, UART access, SSH/Telnet enabling).\n*   Technical details about how the default password is generated.\n*   Step-by-step instructions on how to exploit the vulnerabilities.\n*   Code snippets and screenshots illustrating the vulnerabilities.\n*   Information about the router's firmware and hardware.\n\n**4. Other CVEs mentioned in the content:**\n\n*   CVE-2025-28201 - An issue in Victure RX1800 EN_V1.0.0_r12_110933 allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain root access. (Using UART)\n*   CVE-2025-28202 - Incorrect access control in Victure RX1800 EN_V1.0.0_r12_110933 allows attackers to enable SSH and Telnet services without authentication.\n*   CVE-2025-28203 - Victure RX1800 EN_V1.0.0_r12_110933 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability.\n\nThe content from victure.com is unrelated and provides no useful information regarding the vulnerability.",

CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password is a child of CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials, and both are secondary considerations because the default password is based on the MAC address. The weakness is the **use of a default password**, and the fact that it's derived from the MAC address makes it predictable and easier to exploit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default password** (CWE-1393). This leads to a **weak password** that is predictable since it is derived from the MAC address. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router's configuration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **use of a default password**, CWE-1393, which is further weakened by the fact that the default password includes the last 8 digits of the MAC address, which can be considered a form of **hard-coding**. The evidence clearly points to the **use of a weak default password**, making CWE-1393 the most appropriate primary classification. The secondary classifications (CWE-259, CWE-798) are considered due to the password's derivation from the MAC address.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This is not as good as CWE-1393 because it is a class.*\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This is not as good as CWE-1393 because it is more general.*\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This is a good candidate, but CWE-1393 is a more specific name.*\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This is a secondary consideration because the password is based on the MAC address, which can be considered hard-coded.*\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This is a secondary consideration because the password is based on the MAC address, which can be considered hard-coded.*\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*The MAC address is not a Hash.*\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
