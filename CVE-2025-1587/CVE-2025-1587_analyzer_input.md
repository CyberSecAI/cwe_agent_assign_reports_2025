# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1587

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Telecom Billing Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function addrecords of the file main.cpp of the component Add New Record. The manipulation of the argument name/phonenumber leads to **buffer overflow**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of argument name/phonenumber
- **product:** SourceCodester Telecom Billing Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** Add New Record

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-1587 is related to the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by using `scanf` to receive data into a character array (`name`) without specifying a maximum length, allowing for unbounded input and a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
The buffer overflow allows writing data of any length into the `name` variable, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing input larger than the allocated buffer size (50 bytes) to the `name` variable.
- The attack requires navigating to the `while(1)` loop in the main program, which is reached by pressing enter after program execution and selecting option one from the menu.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the program.
- Knowledge of the program's execution flow to reach the vulnerable input point.

**Mitigation or fix:**
- Use safer input functions like `fgets` or `scanf` with a maximum field width specifier (e.g., `scanf("%49s", name);`) to prevent writing beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- Compile with buffer overflow protection mechanisms (e.g., disabling GS and SDL in Visual Studio can make the vulnerability easier to exploit, so enabling them is a mitigation).

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**
- The vulnerability is located at line 229 within a `while(1)` loop.
- The content provides instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability using Visual Studio 2022, including setting a breakpoint and observing the buffer overflow in the memory monitoring window.
