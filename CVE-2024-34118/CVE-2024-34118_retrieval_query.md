    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 396.46)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 390.24)
