    ## WEAKNESS: 'local privilege escalation'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (Score: 162.58)

The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors....

### 2. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 162.57)
