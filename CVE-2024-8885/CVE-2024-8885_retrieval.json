This could potentially lead to complete system compromise.\\n\\n* **Attack Vectors:** Local attacker with the ability to interact with the affected Sophos Intercept X for Windows installation.\\n\\n* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable Sophos Intercept X is installed.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a local privilege escalation flaw in the Device Encryption component of Sophos Intercept X for Windows. It allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges through arbitrary file write capabilities. The vulnerability is resolved in Device Encryption version 2024.2.1.6, with specific fixes included in FTS version 2024.2.3.9.2 and LTS version 2024.1.0.45 or newer.\",
