# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf sync_linked_regs() must preserve subreg_def Range propagation must not affect subreg_def marks, otherwise the following example is rewritten by verifier incorrectly when **BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag** is set 0 call bpf_ktime_get_ns call bpf_ktime_get_ns 1 r0 &= 0x7fffffff after verifier r0 &= 0x7fffffff 2 w1 = w0 rewrites w1 = w0 3 if w0 r11 = 0x2f5674a6 (r) 4 r1 >>= 32 r11 >= 32 r0 = r1 exit (or zero extension of w1 at (2) is missing for architectures that require zero extension for upper register half). The following happens w/o this patch - r0 is marked as not a subreg at (0) - w1 is marked as subreg at (2) - w1 subreg_def is overridden at (3) by copy_register_state() - w1 is read at (5) but mark_insn_zext() does not mark (2) for zero extension, because w1 subreg_def is not set - because of **BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag** verifier inserts random value for hi32 bits of (2) (marked (r)) - this random value is read at (5).

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension (Score: 641.80)

The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses....

### 2. CWE-1390: Weak Authentication (Score: 574.82)

The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct....

### 3. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 567.55)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 4. CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash (Score: 562.56)

The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find mul...

### 5. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (Score: 559.78)

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users....

### 2. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 579.03)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....

### 3. CWE-1390: Weak Authentication (Score: 574.82)

The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct....
