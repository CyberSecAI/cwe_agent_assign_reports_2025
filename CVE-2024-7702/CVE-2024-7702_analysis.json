  "description": "The Contact Form by Bit Form Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the entryID parameter in versions 2.0 to 2.13.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries to already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7702:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n*   The provided content from Wordfence explicitly mentions **CVE-2024-7702**, along with a description of a vulnerability in the \"Contact Form by Bit Form\" plugin. The vulnerability is identified as an **SQL Injection** flaw in the `getLogHistory` function.\n*  The code from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows the `getLogHistory` function at line 968, which is also referenced by wordfence.\n* This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The root cause is an **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**, leading to a **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n*   Specifically, the `entryID` parameter within the `getLogHistory` function is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in a SQL query. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and parameterized queries in the `getLogHistory` function. The code is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection\n*   The Wordfence description indicates \"insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.\"\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, form submission data, or potentially other sensitive information stored in the WordPress database.\n*   **Data Modification or Deletion:** Depending on the attacker's SQL injection payload, they might also be able to modify or delete data in the database.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, using HTTP requests to the WordPress site.\n*   **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `entryID` parameter when calling the `getLogHistory` AJAX action.\n*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or higher privileged user.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Administrator Level Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access or higher to the WordPress site.\n*   **Understanding of WordPress AJAX:** The attacker needs to know how WordPress AJAX requests are structured.\n\n**Additional Notes from the provided Content:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects \"Contact Form by Bit Form\" plugin versions 2.0 up to 2.13.9.\n*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.13.10 and above.\n*   The Trac link in the Wordfence report points to the `getLogHistory` function within the provided `AdminAjax.php` file, further solidifying the accuracy of the report.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-7702 is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability present in the \"Contact Form by Bit Form\" plugin. It allows an authenticated attacker with admin-level access to potentially steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions in the database due to improper sanitization of user input in the `getLogHistory` function.",

There are no other relationships that directly influence the selection of CWE-89 for this specific vulnerability, as the evidence clearly points to **SQL Injection** due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (Identified by CWE-89).\n2.  **Weakness:** **SQL Injection**.\n3.  **Impact:** Extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and conclusion strongly align with the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary. The root cause is explicitly stated as **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, directly leading to **SQL Injection**. The selection of CWE-89 is based on its accurate representation of this root cause and its base-level abstraction.

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1595.96\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
