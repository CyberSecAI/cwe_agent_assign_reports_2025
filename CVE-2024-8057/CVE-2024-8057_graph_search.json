This issue arises because the system allows an unauthenticated attacker to sign up with a basic account and perform actions that should be restricted to admin users. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) and other significant issues, impacting the systems stability and security. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1392 CWE-1188 CWE-472 CWE-289 CWE-285 CWE-1333 CWE-400 CWE-269 CWE-307 CWE-306",
