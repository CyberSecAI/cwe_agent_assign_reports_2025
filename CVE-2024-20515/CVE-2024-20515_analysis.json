  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a **lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings**. An attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view device credentials that are normally not visible to Read-Only Administrators.",

This would lead to information disclosure.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a remote attacker exploiting the web-based management interface.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a Read-Only Administrator account and must be able to remotely access the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco ISE device. The attacker also needs to browse to specific page to trigger the vulnerability.",

The **incorrect assignment of Read-Only Administrator privileges** allows access to sensitive data. |\n| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The sensitive data is exposed to an unauthorized control sphere (Read-Only Administrators). |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the privilege-related structure. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a Base-level CWE that fits well because the root cause is a misconfigured privilege that allows Read-Only Administrators to access data they should not. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability results in resources being exposed to the wrong control sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe668\n    cwe266\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266), leading to the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized control sphere (CWE-668).\n\nCWE-266 (Root Cause) -> CWE-668 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"**lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings**\" and the fact that \"An attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability\".
