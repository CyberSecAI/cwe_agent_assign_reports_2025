  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vxlan vnifilter Fix **unlocked deletion** of default FDB entry When a VNI is deleted from a VXLAN device in vnifilter mode, the FDB entry associated with the default remote (assuming one was configured) is deleted without holding the hash lock. This is wrong and will result in a warning [1] being generated by the lockdep annotation that was added by commit ebe642067455 (vxlan Create wrappers for FDB lookup). Reproducer # ip link add vx0 up type vxlan dstport 4789 external vnifilter local 192.0.2.1 # bridge vni add vni 10010 remote 198.51.100.1 dev vx0 # bridge vni del vni 10010 dev vx0 Fix by acquiring the hash lock before the deletion and releasing it afterwards. Blame the original commit that introduced the issue rather than the one that exposed it.

The vulnerability stems from the **unlocked deletion** of an FDB entry, indicating a locking issue. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is a Class-level CWE. While it doesn't have direct parent-child relationships apparent in the provided information that strongly influence this decision, the nature of the vulnerability directly points to a locking issue. Other potential CWEs like race conditions (CWE-362, CWE-367) could be related, but the description focuses explicitly on the **unlocked deletion**, making CWE-667 the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe667 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper locking** during the deletion of an FDB entry. This leads to a race condition (though not explicitly stated, it's implied), and ultimately to potential data corruption or system instability.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-667 (Improper Locking)\n  - **Impact:** Data corruption, system instability (implied).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis centers on the **unlocked deletion** of an FDB entry, which is the core of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions this **unlocked deletion**, leading to the selection of CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as the primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-667 with a high similarity score.\n\nThe choice of CWE-667 is at the Class level. The evidence does not strongly suggest a more specific Base-level CWE within the \"Improper Locking\" category, making the Class-level mapping the most appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: While an exceptional condition might occur due to the improper locking, this is a consequence rather than the root cause.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Selected as Primary CWE*: The description states the FDB entry is deleted **without holding the hash lock**.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no mention of unchecked return values in the description.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no mention of missing checks for unusual conditions, the issue is with locking.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: Although a race condition is implied, the description focuses on the lack of locking.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This is not related to information exposure.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no mention of uninitialized pointers.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This is not related to origin validation.\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This is not related to the order of operations.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This is not related to assertions.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 426.81\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to
