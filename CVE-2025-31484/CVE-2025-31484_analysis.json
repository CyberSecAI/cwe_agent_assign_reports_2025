  "description": "conda-forge infrastructure holds common configurations and settings for key pieces of the conda-forge infrastructure. Between 2025-02-10 and 2025-04-01, conda-forge infrastructure used the **wrong token for Azures cf-staging access**. This bug meant that any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, bypassing our feedstock-token + upload process. The security logs on anaconda.org were check for any packages that were not copied from the cf-staging to the conda-forge channel and none were found.",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-31484 as it explicitly states the CVE ID.\n\n**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect variable injected into the Azure variable group in the Pulumi configuration, using the production Binstar token instead of the staging one. This was introduced during a Pulumi configuration update and missed during code review.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Incorrect configuration management leading to the use of a production token in a staging environment. This allowed bypassing the intended feedstock-token + upload process.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, potentially introducing malicious packages.\n*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious or compromised feedstock maintainer could exploit the misconfiguration to upload unauthorized packages.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires being a conda-forge feedstock maintainer.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Corrected the Pulumi configuration to use the staging Binstar token in the Azure variable group. Patched versions are >=2025-04-02.\n*   **Affected versions:** >=2025-02-10, <=2025-04-01\n*   **Severity:** Critical\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including:\n\n*   Specific details about the configuration error.\n*   The individuals involved in identifying and remediating the issue.\n*   Investigation steps taken to determine if the vulnerability was exploited.\n*   The reason for keeping the variable name (backwards compatibility with smithy).",

CWE-287 and CWE-863 are related as potential consequences of using a hard-coded key. Specifically, a hard-coded key can lead to improper authentication or authorization bypass. CWE-321 is at the Variant level, which is the most specific and preferred abstraction level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe287 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe321\n    cwe863 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect configuration management** which led to the **use of a production token in a staging environment (CWE-321)**. This resulted in bypassing the intended feedstock-token + upload process, effectively leading to **improper authentication (CWE-287)** and **incorrect authorization (CWE-863)** where any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-287 and CWE-863 due to the description mentioning bypassing authentication and authorization. However, the **root cause** was explicitly stated as using the **wrong token (production instead of staging)** which aligns perfectly with CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-321 is strong: \"Incorrect variable injected into the Azure variable group in the Pulumi configuration, using the production Binstar token instead of the staging one.\" This clearly indicates a hard-coded key was used in the wrong context.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) are consequences of the hard-coded key, but not the primary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) as it precisely describes the coding error.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
