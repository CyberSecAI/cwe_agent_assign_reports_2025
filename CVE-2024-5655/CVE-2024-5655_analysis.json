CWE-639 and CWE-267 are possible secondary CWEs.

The specific mechanism isn't clear from the description. It might involve using a user-controlled key (CWE-639) or exploiting unsafe actions associated with a particular privilege (CWE-267), but more information is needed to confirm these.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to an **improper authorization** issue (CWE-285). The description indicates that an attacker can trigger a pipeline as another user under certain circumstances. This clearly suggests a failure in authorization.\n\nCWE-285 is a class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. However, the vulnerability description lacks the necessary details to identify a more precise root cause.

The secondary CWEs considered, CWE-639 and CWE-267, represent possible ways an attacker might achieve this.\n\nThe retriever results also include CWE-400, CWE-696, CWE-1286, CWE-1333 and CWE-532, but these are less relevant.\n- CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity): There is no mention of resource consumption or regular expressions in the description.\n- CWE-696 (Incorrect Behavior Order): The description doesn't provide insight into order of operations being a factor.\n- CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input): There is no indication of input validation issues.\n- CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File): The description does not mention logging or sensitive information being logged.\n\nBased on the limited information, mapping to CWE-285 is the most appropriate choice.
