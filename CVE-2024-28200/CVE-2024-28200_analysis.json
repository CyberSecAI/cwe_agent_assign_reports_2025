CWE-306 was chosen as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description indicates a complete lack of authentication for the user interface. CWE-288 was considered as a secondary weakness, as it represents an authentication bypass, but only if an alternate path or channel exists. The abstraction level of Base was preferred for both CWEs as it provides a more specific representation of the weakness compared to the Class level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (**CWE-306**). This allows an attacker to bypass the intended authentication mechanism and access the user interface, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability.
