This allows malicious devices to present certificates that are not rejected properly. The use of a client certificate reduces the risk for random devices to take advantage of this flaw.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'fail to verify that a remote devices certificate has not already expired', 'has not yet become valid'
