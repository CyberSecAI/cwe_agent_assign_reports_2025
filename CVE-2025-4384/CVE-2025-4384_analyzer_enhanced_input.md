## Vulnerability Description
The MQTT add-on of PcVue fails to verify that a remote devices certificate has not already expired or has not yet become valid. This allows malicious devices to present certificates that are not rejected properly. The use of a client certificate reduces the risk for random devices to take advantage of this flaw.
