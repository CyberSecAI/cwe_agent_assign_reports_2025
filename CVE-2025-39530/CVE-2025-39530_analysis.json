The induced action in this case leads to **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**, where the injected input is not properly sanitized, leading to Stored XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))**, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user. This leads to **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**, where the injected data is not properly neutralized, leading to stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))** as the primary root cause, as the vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly mention CSRF. The secondary vulnerability is **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**, as the CSRF vulnerability leads to stored XSS. The relationship graph shows that CSRF can precede XSS, which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe evidence for **CWE-352** comes from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which states \"rootcause: Cross-Site Request Forgery\".
