## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A command execution vulnerability was found in the "/systemstatus/ip_status.php" file. The vulnerability is due to the "subnet" parameter not being properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject and execute system commands.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Command Execution vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
Attackers can achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

Attack vectors:
Exploitation occurs via the "subnet" parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with malicious code in the "subnet" parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

Mitigation or fix:
1.  Avoid direct system calls with user input.
2.  Use parameterized APIs or libraries.
3.  Strict input validation and sanitization.
4.  Limit command execution context.
