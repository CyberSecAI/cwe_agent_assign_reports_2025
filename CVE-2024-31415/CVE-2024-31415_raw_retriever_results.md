# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-31415
## Query
The Eaton Foreseer software provides the feasibility for the user to configure external servers for multiple purposes such as network management, user management, etc. The software uses encryption to store these configurations securely on the host machine. However, the keys used for this encryption were insecurely stored, which could be abused to possibly change or remove the server configuration.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insecurely stored encryption keys'
