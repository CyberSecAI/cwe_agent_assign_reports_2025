# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-21883
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice Fix deinitializing VF in error path If ice_ena_vfs() fails after calling ice_create_vf_entries(), it frees all VFs without removing them from snapshot PF-VF mailbox list, leading to list corruption. Reproducer devlink dev eswitch set $PF1_PCI mode switchdev ip l s $PF1 up ip l s $PF1 promisc on sleep 1 echo 1 > /sys/class/net/$PF1/device/sriov_numvfs sleep 1 echo 1 > /sys/class/net/$PF1/device/sriov_numvfs Trace (minimized) list_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffff8882e241c6f0), but was 0000000000000000. (next=ffff888455da1330). kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c29!

Move the removing to ice_free_vf_entries(), which is also being called in other places where VFs are being removed (including ice_free_vfs() itself).
