The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**missing permission check**\" in the `onCreate` method of `NotificationAccessConfirmationActivity.java`, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862. This **missing check** allows an app with notification access to be hidden in Settings, leading to a local escalation of privilege.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-862 with a high score. While other CWEs like CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered, they are less specific. CWE-269 is discouraged, and CWE-285 implies an existing authorization check that is performed incorrectly, which is not the case here.\n\nThe choice of CWE-862 is based on the direct evidence of a **missing permission check**, its alignment with the CWE definition, and the MITRE mapping guidance favoring specific CWEs over generic ones.
