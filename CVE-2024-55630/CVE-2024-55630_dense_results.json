  "query": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Joplins HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerabilitys only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
