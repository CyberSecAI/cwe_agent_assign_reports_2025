# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50078

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth Call **iso_exit() on module unload If iso_init() has been called**, **iso_exit() must be called on module unload. Without that**, **the struct proto that iso_init() registered with proto_register() becomes invalid**, which could cause unpredictable problems later. In my case, with CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION enabled, loading the module again usually triggers this BUG() list_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffffffffb5355fd0), but was 0000000000000068. (next=ffffffffc0a010d0). ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c29! Oops invalid opcode 0000
