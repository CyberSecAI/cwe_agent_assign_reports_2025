  "description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor Best Elementor Addon, Templates, Widgets, Kits & WooCommerce Builders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9 via the init_content_register_user_email_controls function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including usernames and passwords of any users who register via the Login | Register Form widget, as long as that user opens the email notification for successful registration.",

This function, when processing user registration via the Login/Register Form widget, exposes sensitive information in email notifications.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin transmits usernames and passwords of newly registered users within the email notification sent to these users after successful registration.\n-  **Lack of Secure Handling of Credentials:**  The plugin fails to handle sensitive information such as usernames and passwords securely by including them in email notifications.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can extract sensitive data such as usernames and passwords from email notifications.\n- This could allow attackers to gain access to user accounts, potentially escalating privileges and causing further harm.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the email notifications sent to newly registered users.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.\n- The attacker must be able to access or intercept email notifications sent by the WordPress site.",

The vulnerability results in sensitive information being exposed to an unauthorized actor. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the hierarchical structure. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, but it accurately reflects the **sensitive information exposure** that is the core of this vulnerability. Lower-level CWEs might specify the mechanism of exposure, but the description focuses on the fact that sensitive data is revealed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Sensitive Information Exposure** due to inclusion of usernames and passwords in email notifications.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (usernames and passwords).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is the **exposure of sensitive information**. The description explicitly states that the plugin makes it possible for attackers to \"extract sensitive data including usernames and passwords.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the plugin transmits usernames and passwords of newly registered users within email notifications. CWE-200 directly addresses this **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the class level because the provided information doesn't go into the specifics of *how* the information is being exposed beyond the fact that it's included in an email. While other CWEs like CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) could also be considered, CWE-200 is a more general fit and accurately captures the core weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability isn't about external control of parameters but the **exposure of sensitive information**.*\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability isn't about authorization bypass, but the **exposure of sensitive information**.*\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability isn't about CSRF, but the **exposure of sensitive information**.*\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability isn't about authorization bypass, but the **exposure of sensitive information**.*\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is about sensitive information in email notifications, not files or directories.*\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but determined to be too specific.
