This means that a malicious actor can potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the website without their knowledge.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n*   A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to perform actions they did not intend to, such as modifying settings, deleting content, or creating new user accounts. This can lead to various impacts, depending on the actions that the attacker can force the user to perform.\\n*   The specific impact can vary case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that targets a vulnerable function within the plugin. This malicious request is then sent to the victim, often by enticing the victim to click a malicious link or view a malicious website.\\n*   The victim needs to be logged into the WordPress site when the malicious request is executed.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the website.\\n*   The attacker must be able to lure the victim into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.\\n*   The attacker needs to know the actions they want to force the victim into performing and then create a corresponding malicious request.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n*   The vulnerability is considered low severity with a CVSS score of 7.1 (low on the Patchstack scale)\\n*   There is currently no official fix available for this vulnerability.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO on Oct 22, 2024 and was published by Patchstack on Dec 12, 2024.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A1: Broken Access Control.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold':
