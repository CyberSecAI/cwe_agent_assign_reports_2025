# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21739

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hbas data structure struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This structure is allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host allocation. During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(), this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the (platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released. Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using the just-released struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This causes a ****use-after-free** situation** Call trace kfree+0x60/0x2d8 (P) kvfree+0x44/0x60 blk_crypto_profile_destroy_callback+0x28/0x70 devm_action_release+0x1c/0x30 release_nodes+0x6c/0x108 devres_release_all+0x98/0x100 device_unbind_cleanup+0x20/0x70 really_probe+0x218/0x2d0 In other words, the initialisation code flow is platform-device probe ufshcd_pltfrm_init() ufshcd_alloc_host() scsi_host_alloc() allocation of struct ufs_hba creation of scsi-host devices devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver removal ufshcd_dealloc_host() scsi_host_put() put_device(scsi-host) release of struct ufs_hba put_device(platform-device) crypto cleanup handler To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are destroyed before SCSI (as theyve been registered after) * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a side-effect * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as its not needed anymore * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget adding the cleanup

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified weakness is CWE-416 **Use After Free**, which accurately reflects the vulnerability description. The other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results may be related in other contexts, but are not direct matches for this vulnerability. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which provides the appropriate level of detail for this vulnerability.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  Improper resource management leads to a **use-after-free** condition.
2.  The **use-after-free** condition allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states a **use-after-free situation** occurs in the Linux kernel's scsi ufs core. The **use-after-free** happens when the crypto cleanup code runs, using the released `struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile`.

The primary CWE, CWE-416 **Use After Free**, directly matches the vulnerability description and key phrases. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top candidate.

Other CWEs such as **CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**, **CWE-415 Double Free**, **CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource**, and **CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource** are not applicable because the vulnerability is a straightforward **use-after-free** and not a race condition, double free, use of uninitialized resource or missing initialization of resource.

The final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Variant level CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to improper locking.*

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to concurrent execution or race conditions.*
