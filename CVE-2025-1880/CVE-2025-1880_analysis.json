  "description": "A vulnerability was found in i-Drive i11 and i12 up to 20250227. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is an unknown function of the component Device Pairing. The manipulation leads to **authentication bypass** by primary weakness. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. It was not possible to identify the current maintainer of the product. It must be assumed that the product is end-of-life.",

However, the device pairing process is based on MAC address recognition, which can be bypassed.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Bypassable device pairing mechanism.\n*   Reliance on MAC address recognition for pairing.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful bypassing of the device pairing grants unauthorized access to the device\u2019s network.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Obtaining the MAC address of a paired device (e.g., through ARP scanning).\n*   Spoofing the MAC address.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the dashcam.\n*   Ability to perform ARP scanning or other MAC address discovery techniques.\n*   Ability to spoof MAC addresses.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide information on mitigation or fixes.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\nThe content explicitly states how the pairing process can be bypassed by spoofing the MAC address after obtaining it through methods like ARP scanning.",

The vulnerability is a direct authentication bypass. |\n| CWE-807 | Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The MAC address is an untrusted input used in a security decision. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-305 [Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness] is a base CWE that directly addresses the described vulnerability. CWE-807 [Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision] is a secondary CWE, as it is an untrusted input (MAC address) which can be modified to bypass authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **authentication bypass** due to the reliance on a bypassable MAC address recognition for device pairing. This results in unauthorized access to the device's network. The root cause is the **incorrect** implementation of the authentication mechanism.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-305 [Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness] as the primary weakness due to the direct **authentication bypass**. The analysis was then refined to include CWE-807 [Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision] because the pairing mechanism is bypassable since it relies on MAC address recognition, which can be spoofed. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports these mappings: \"The dashcam's authentication mechanism relies on a default password combined with a second factor (device registration). However, the device pairing process is based on MAC address recognition, which can be bypassed.\"\n\nThe final selection is at the optimal level of specificity.
