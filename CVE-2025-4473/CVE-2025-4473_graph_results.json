  "query": "The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_request() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to control where the plugin sends outgoing emails. By pointing SMTP to their own server, attackers could capture password reset emails intended for administrators, and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.",
