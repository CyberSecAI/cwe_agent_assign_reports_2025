# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2921

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected is an unknown function of the file /etc/passwd. The manipulation with the input Realtek leads to **use of default password**. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of default password**
- **impact:** use of default password
- **product:** Netis WF-2404
- **version:** 1.1.124EN
- **component:** /etc/passwd

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-2921: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

The provided content details a security assessment of a Netis WF-2404 router using a Flipper Zero. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The router uses a weak default password ("guest") and has an exploitable UART interface. The firmware is old (2010) and lacks modern security features.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Weak Default Password:** The default password "guest" is present and usable.
*   **UART Access:** The router has an accessible UART interface that allows shell access.
*   **Exposed Password Hash:** The root password hash is stored in `/etc/passwd` (though the file is named with a Cyrillic character 'ะต' instead of 'e').
*   **Outdated Firmware:** The firmware is very old (2010) and likely contains numerous known vulnerabilities.
*   **Limited Shell:** The BusyBox shell has a limited command set, but provides enough functionality to extract information.
*   **Read-Only Filesystem:** The filesystem is initially read-only, but the author explores potential bypasses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Obtaining root access allows for complete control of the router.
*   **Network Compromise:** A compromised router can be used to intercept traffic, launch attacks, or gain access to the internal network.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored on the router (if any) could be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the router to connect to the UART interface.
*   **Flipper Zero:** Utilizes a Flipper Zero to interact with the UART port.
*   **Password Cracking:** Cracks the root password hash using John the Ripper.
*   **Default Credentials:** Uses the default "guest" password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the router.
*   **Hardware Skills:** Basic soldering/wire manipulation skills are helpful for connecting to the UART pins.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of UART communication, Linux command line, and password cracking techniques.
*   **Tools:** Flipper Zero, computer with a serial terminal program (e.g., screen), and password cracking software (e.g., John the Ripper).

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   **Change Default Password:** Immediately change the default password to a strong, unique password.
*   **Firmware Update:** Update the router's firmware to the latest available version (if any).
*   **Disable Remote Access:** Disable remote administration access if not needed.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the router on a separate network segment.
*   **Replace Router:** Consider replacing the router with a more modern and secure model.

**Additional Details:**
The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing the specific steps taken to exploit the router and the tools used. It also highlights the challenges faced during the process, such as the tiny test points and the limited BusyBox shell. The author also explores the `flash` command for potential firmware manipulation.
