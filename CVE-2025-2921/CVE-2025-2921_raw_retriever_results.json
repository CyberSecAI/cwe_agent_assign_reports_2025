  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected is an unknown function of the file /etc/passwd. The manipulation with the input Realtek leads to use of default password. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
