  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected is an unknown function of the file /etc/passwd. The manipulation with the input Realtek leads to **use of default password**. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-2921: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content details a security assessment of a Netis WF-2404 router using a Flipper Zero. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe router uses a weak default password (\"guest\") and has an exploitable UART interface. The firmware is old (2010) and lacks modern security features.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Weak Default Password:** The default password \"guest\" is present and usable.\n*   **UART Access:** The router has an accessible UART interface that allows shell access.\n*   **Exposed Password Hash:** The root password hash is stored in `/etc/passwd` (though the file is named with a Cyrillic character '\u0435' instead of 'e').\n*   **Outdated Firmware:** The firmware is very old (2010) and likely contains numerous known vulnerabilities.\n*   **Limited Shell:** The BusyBox shell has a limited command set, but provides enough functionality to extract information.\n*   **Read-Only Filesystem:** The filesystem is initially read-only, but the author explores potential bypasses.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** Obtaining root access allows for complete control of the router.\n*   **Network Compromise:** A compromised router can be used to intercept traffic, launch attacks, or gain access to the internal network.\n*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored on the router (if any) could be exposed.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the router to connect to the UART interface.\n*   **Flipper Zero:** Utilizes a Flipper Zero to interact with the UART port.\n*   **Password Cracking:** Cracks the root password hash using John the Ripper.\n*   **Default Credentials:** Uses the default \"guest\" password.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the router.\n*   **Hardware Skills:** Basic soldering/wire manipulation skills are helpful for connecting to the UART pins.\n*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of UART communication, Linux command line, and password cracking techniques.\n*   **Tools:** Flipper Zero, computer with a serial terminal program (e.g., screen), and password cracking software (e.g., John the Ripper).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   **Change Default Password:** Immediately change the default password to a strong, unique password.\n*   **Firmware Update:** Update the router's firmware to the latest available version (if any).\n*   **Disable Remote Access:** Disable remote administration access if not needed.\n*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the router on a separate network segment.\n*   **Replace Router:** Consider replacing the router with a more modern and secure model.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing the specific steps taken to exploit the router and the tools used. It also highlights the challenges faced during the process, such as the tiny test points and the limited BusyBox shell. The author also explores the `flash` command for potential firmware manipulation.",

CWE-259, a variant of CWE-798, specifies the **use of hard-coded passwords** and represents a more specific case. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference content both explicitly mention the use of default/hard-coded passwords. Therefore, mapping to CWE-798 with consideration of CWE-259 provides a comprehensive representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default password** (CWE-798), which allows unauthorized access and control. This leads to potential remote code execution, network compromise, and data exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identifies the **use of a default password** as the primary weakness. Both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content mention this. The selection of CWE-798 is strongly supported by the evidence, which mentions the **use of a default password** \"guest\". Since a password is a type of credential, CWE-798 is the best fit, but CWE-259 is a very close candidate since it's more specific for passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
