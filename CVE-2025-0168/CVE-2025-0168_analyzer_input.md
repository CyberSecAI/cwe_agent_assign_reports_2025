## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0168 (Note: This is a placeholder, the content helps determine the characteristics of the CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `job-recruitment-in-php` application. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `$person` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.  The application's code constructs a SQL query by concatenating the user-provided `$person` parameter directly into the SQL query string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:**  A successful SQL injection attack could allow a malicious actor to access, modify, or delete sensitive information stored in the application's database. This could include user data, confidential business information, or any other data stored in the database.
- **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database server's permissions and the nature of the application, an attacker may be able to escalate the attack to compromise the database server itself, or gain a foothold on the system hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP GET request to the `_parse/_feedback_system.php` script. The attacker manipulates the `person` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection payload.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable parameter is `$person`.
- The vulnerable file is `_parse/_feedback_system.php`.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject a simple SQL statement using the `person` parameter. The example shows an injection with `person=1*`, which is likely meant to inject a malicious SQL fragment.
- The vulnerable application is called `job-recruitment-in-php`.
