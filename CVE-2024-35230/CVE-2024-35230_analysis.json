  "description": "GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. In affected versions the welcome and about page includes version and revision information about the software in use (including library and components used). This information is sensitive from a security point of view because it allows software used by the server to be easily identified. This issue has been patched in version 2.26.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

This information disclosure can be used by attackers to identify vulnerable software components and plan targeted attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Information Disclosure: The software exposes sensitive version information in its welcome page footer and about page, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users. This violates the principle of least privilege and makes it easier to identify potentially vulnerable software.\n- Lack of Access Control: The version and build information is visible to all users, regardless of their authentication status or privileges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Attackers can identify the exact version of GeoServer and its components running on the server.\n- This allows attackers to target known vulnerabilities specific to the identified versions.\n- This makes it easier for attackers to plan and execute more effective attacks by exploiting known weaknesses in the components.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network Access: An attacker can access the vulnerable information through HTTP requests.\n- Specifically, the welcome page footer and the about page (accessible to anyone) expose the information.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- No special privileges or authentication is required.\n- Attacker needs network access to the GeoServer instance",

CWE-200 has child CWEs that are more specific, but none of them fit the description exactly. CWE-497, which represents exposure of sensitive *system* information, is a closely related Base CWE and is added as a secondary CWE since the version and revision information are considered system level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**, which in turn allows attackers to identify vulnerable software components and plan targeted attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the welcome and about pages expose sensitive version and revision information, allowing attackers to identify vulnerable software components. The key phrase \"**improper access control**\" and impact \"information disclosure\" helped narrow down the possible CWEs.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authorization and information exposure. However, after reviewing the CWE specifications and the vulnerability description, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) emerged as the most appropriate primary CWE. This is because the vulnerability directly involves the exposure of sensitive information (version details) to unauthorized actors (unauthenticated users). Since the information disclosed is system-level, CWE-497 is added as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, making it a more specific representation of the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately capture the nature of the weakness and its potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.486\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have that information.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**CWE-200** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor is the most appropriate because the description explicitly states that version and revision information is exposed to unauthenticated users. The security implication is that attackers can use this information to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the software.\n\n**CWE-497** Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere is added as a secondary because the version and revision information exposed relates to the system.",
