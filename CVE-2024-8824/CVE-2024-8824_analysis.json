  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JB2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24262.",

The primary classification is CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] because the description explicitly mentions **\"Out-Of-Bounds Read\"**, and the vulnerability involves reading past the end of an allocated object.

The description states, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read], which involves reading data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.\n*   **CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]:** This is a secondary CWE that represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\"**. CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is a broader category, but it accurately reflects the **lack of input validation** that leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write]: While related to buffer overflows, this CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability involves reading, not writing, out of bounds.\n*   CWE-1284 [CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input]: This CWE is more specific to quantity validation and doesn't fully capture the general **lack of input validation**.\n*   CWE-122 [CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow]: This is not applicable because the description only specifies an out-of-bounds read, and does not specify that a heap-based buffer overflow is the root cause.\n*   CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read]: While similar to CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read], CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] is more commonly used and directly reflects the **\"Out-Of-Bounds Read\"** vulnerability.",
