  "description": "In danny-avila/librechat version git 0c2a583, there is an improper **input validation vulnerability**. The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads. When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload file size. This can lead to a server crash due to **out-of-memory errors** when handling large files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to a fix in the LibreChat project addressing avatar upload handling. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe original code used `multer` to handle file uploads, reading the file buffer directly. This approach was refactored to use `fs` (file system) for reading the file and to enhance file validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe original code lacked sufficient file validation and potentially had issues with how file data was handled, potentially leading to vulnerabilities related to file size, type, or malicious content. The commit message indicates a refactoring to address these concerns.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact isn't explicitly stated, but insufficient file validation could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (e.g., uploading excessively large files), or potentially allow malicious users to upload and execute arbitrary code if the uploaded files were processed insecurely.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Uploading large files to exhaust server resources.\n*   Uploading files with unexpected content or types.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker would need to be able to upload files to the server (e.g., a registered user or someone with write access to the upload endpoint).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Refactored avatar upload handling to use `fs` for file reading.\n*   Enhanced file validation, including checking file size against a configurable limit (`fileSizeLimit` or `avatarSizeLimit`) and verifying the file type against a list of supported MIME types (`supportedMimeTypes`).\n*   Added specific size limit for avatar uploads.\n*   Improved error messages to indicate the endpoint or avatar upload when file size limits are exceeded.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\nYes, this content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It outlines the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability, including the use of `fs` and the enhanced file validation logic. It also details the specific parameters used in the validation process (file size limits, MIME types).",

This is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the **lack of limits** on file upload size, leading to excessive resource allocation. The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption is a parent-child relationship, as CWE-400 is a child of CWE-770. This means that CWE-770 can lead to CWE-400. Also, CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input can precede CWE-770. The relationship is a CANPRECEDE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (specifically, a **lack of validation** on the file size). This leads to **uncontrolled resource allocation**, which then results in **out-of-memory errors** and ultimately a **denial of service** (server crash).\n\nThe chain is as follows:\n1.  **Improper Input Validation** (Lack of file size limit)\n2.  **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (CWE-770)\n3.  **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400)\n4.  **Out-of-Memory Errors**\n5.  **Denial of Service**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-1284, CWE-20, CWE-770, and CWE-789. After carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, I have concluded that CWE-770 best represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The application **fails to limit the allocation of memory** for uploaded files, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description: \"When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is **no limit on the upload file size.** This can lead to a server crash due to **out-of-memory errors** when handling large files.\"\n\nCWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **unrestricted allocation of resources**, which is the root cause of the problem. While CWE-400 is a valid secondary CWE, it represents the impact of the vulnerability rather than the underlying cause. CWE-1284 is considered because the **lack of file size validation** is a form of improper input validation, but CWE-770 is more specific to the resource allocation issue.\n\n**CWE Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** While the vulnerability involves **improper input validation**, CWE-20 is too generic. The more specific CWE-770 and CWE-1284 are more appropriate.\n*   **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value:** This CWE is similar to CWE-770, but CWE-770 focuses on the **lack of limits**, which is more precise in this case.\n*   **CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound:** This CWE is not relevant as there is no mention of integer overflow or wraparound in the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** This CWE is not relevant as there is no mention of out-of-bounds read in the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions:** This CWE is not the best fit, as the core issue is the **absence of a file size limit** rather than a failure to check for unusual conditions.\n*   **CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions:** Not relevant as the vulnerability description doesn't mention insecure permissions for temporary files.\n*   **CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency:** Not relevant as the vulnerability description is about the size of the upload not the frequency.",
