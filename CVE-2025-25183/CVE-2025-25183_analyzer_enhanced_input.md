## Vulnerability Description
vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Maliciously constructed statements can lead to **hash collisions**, resulting in cache reuse, which can interfere with subsequent responses and cause unintended behavior. Prefix caching makes use of Pythons built-in hash() function. As of Python 3.12, the behavior of hash(None) has changed to be a predictable constant value. This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit **hash collisions**. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior, someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-25183 based on provided content:

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per instructions)

**Vulnerability Summary:**

The vLLM project is vulnerable to hash collisions in its prefix caching mechanism due to the predictable hash value of `None` in Python 3.12. This allows a malicious actor to potentially manipulate the cache with crafted prompts, interfering with subsequent responses.

**Details extracted from the content:**

*   **Root cause:**  The change in Python 3.12 where `hash(None)` returns a predictable constant value.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable hash collisions in the prefix cache.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Cache reuse with potentially malicious content, leading to interference with responses and potentially inaccurate results.
*   **Attack vectors:** Maliciously constructed prompts designed to collide with other prompts in use.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Knowledge of prompts in use and the predictable hashing behavior.
*   **Mitigation/fix:**  Initialize hashes with a value that is no longer constant and predictable (using a string like `'None'` instead of `None` directly).  The content also suggests that using a more collision-resistant hashing algorithm (like SHA256) would be a more robust solution, but would impact performance and memory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is considered **Low** severity.
*   The fix has been merged into the `main` branch via pull request [#12621](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12621).
