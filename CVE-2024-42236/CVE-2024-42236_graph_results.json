  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb gadget configfs Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy() Userspace provided string s could trivially have the length zero. Left unchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form `if (str[0 - 1] == \\n) followed closely by an OOB write in the form `str[0 - 1] = \\0`. There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long. Lets supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.",
