Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup, kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change(). As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before incrementing userspace_irqchip_in_use kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change() ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created) return -EINVAL if (ret) return ret [...] if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm)) static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use) - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again. Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON() kvm_timer_vcpu_reset() if (timer->enabled) kvm_timer_update_irq() if (!userspace_irqchip()) ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq() ret = vgic_lazy_init() if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm))) if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model != KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2) return -EBUSY WARN_ON(ret) Theoretically, since userspace_irqchip_in_uses functionality can be simply replaced by !irqchip_in_kernel(), get rid of the static key to avoid the mismanagement, which also helps with the syzbot issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an improper use of the `userspace_irqchip_in_use` static key in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) implementation for the ARM64 architecture. This key is intended to track whether a userspace interrupt controller is in use, but its usage is flawed, leading to a race condition and a subsequent WARN_ON failure.\n\n**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**\n\n1.  **Incorrect `userspace_irqchip_in_use` Logic:** The static key `userspace_irqchip_in_use` is incremented in `kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()` when a vPMU (virtual Performance Monitoring Unit) is requested but not properly set up, and the function returns an error. Critically, the key is incremented *after* the timer is enabled, but *before* the function returns due to the vPMU setup failure. If userspace then attempts another initialization, this can lead to the static key being in an incorrect state, triggering a WARN\\_ON in `kvm_timer_update_irq()`.\n2.  **Race Condition:** The described sequence exposes a race between the vCPU initialization and KVM\\_RUN. If a user issues KVM\\_RUN before properly setting up a requested vPMU, the key might be incremented incorrectly, causing the system to enter a state where it assumes a userspace irqchip is in use when it is not.\n3.  **Mismanagement of `userspace_irqchip_in_use`:** The usage of a static key to track a condition that can be reliably determined by checking `irqchip_in_kernel()` leads to unnecessary complexity and potential for errors. The static key is also decremented in `kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy()` but only if `vcpu_has_run_once(vcpu)` which leads to another potential mismatch in the static key state.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Kernel Panic:** The immediate impact is a kernel `WARN_ON` failure that is hit by the syzbot, leading to a kernel panic/crash, which can cause denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Userspace Interaction:** The attack is triggered by a specific sequence of ioctl calls from userspace to the KVM subsystem.\n*   **KVM API:** The specific ioctls involved include:\n    *   `KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT` to initialize a vCPU with `KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3`.\n    *   `KVM_RUN` to start the vCPU execution without proper vPMU setup.\n    *   Potentially subsequent `KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT` calls if the error is ignored by the user.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to use KVM API:** The attacker needs to be able to create VMs and vCPUs via the KVM API, using ioctl operations.\n*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need root or other specific elevated privileges. This is because the vulnerability lies in the normal usage flow of the KVM API.\n\n**More details than the CVE description:**\n\nThe provided content gives a detailed sequence of operations that lead to the WARN\\_ON, which is more than a generic description. It also explains:\n\n*   The exact code flow in the kernel that leads to the issue.\n*   The flawed logic behind `userspace_irqchip_in_use`.\n*   The specific functions where the static key is incremented/decremented.\n*   How the static key is redundant.\n\nThe patch essentially removes the problematic `userspace_irqchip_in_use` static key and replaces its usage with direct checks against the function `irqchip_in_kernel()`. This eliminates the race condition and associated issues.",

The vulnerability occurs because the state of the `userspace_irqchip_in_use` flag is checked and then used, but can change between the check and the use due to the concurrent nature of the KVM architecture. This leads to an incorrect state and subsequent WARN_ON failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe252[\"CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe755,cwe252 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the improper initialization of the vCPU with `KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3`, followed by the failure of `kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()` within `kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()`. This failure leads to a race condition where `userspace_irqchip_in_use` is not correctly managed. Subsequent calls to `KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT` then trigger a WARN_ON due to the incorrect state, leading to a kernel panic.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper use of `userspace_irqchip_in_use`** leads to a race condition (CWE-367).\n2.  **Consequence:** Incorrect state of `userspace_irqchip_in_use`.\n3.  **Impact:** `WARN_ON` failure and kernel panic.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-367 because the core issue lies in the time-of-check time-of-use race condition involving the `userspace_irqchip_in_use` flag. The `userspace_irqchip_in_use` flag is incremented without proper error handling in the `kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()` function, leading to an inconsistent state. This is direct evidence from \"As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before incrementing userspace_irqchip_in_use\". The **improper** management of this flag allows a race condition to occur, where the state of the flag can change between the check and use, leading to the WARN\\_ON.\n\nCWE-362 is a parent Class of CWE-367 and is considered as a secondary candidate because it broadly describes the concurrent execution issue but doesn't specifically capture the TOCTOU nature of the race condition.\n\nCWE-755, Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, is also considered because the error return from `kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()` is ignored, leading to further issues. However, the core weakness is the race condition, making CWE-367 more appropriate. The key phrase \"Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again\" supports this.\n\nCWE-252, Unchecked Return Value, is another candidate because the return value from `kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()` is not checked, which contributes to the problem. However, the race condition is the more direct cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-367 is a Base CWE that accurately captures the TOCTOU race condition, while CWE-362 and CWE-755 represent related but less specific aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
