## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 Get rid of userspace_irqchip_in_use Improper use of userspace_irqchip_in_use led to syzbot hitting the following WARN_ON() in kvm_timer_update_irq() WARNING CPU 0 PID 3281 at arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c459 kvm_timer_update_irq+0x21c/0x394 Call trace kvm_timer_update_irq+0x21c/0x394 arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c459 kvm_timer_vcpu_reset+0x158/0x684 arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c968 kvm_reset_vcpu+0x3b4/0x560 arch/arm64/kvm/reset.c264 kvm_vcpu_set_target arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c1553 [inline] kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_vcpu_init arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c1573 [inline] kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0x112c/0x1b3c arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c1695 kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x4ec/0xf74 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c4658 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c51 [inline] __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c907 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c893 [inline] __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x108/0x184 fs/ioctl.c893 __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c35 [inline] invoke_syscall+0x78/0x1b8 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c49 el0_svc_common+0xe8/0x1b0 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c132 do_el0_svc+0x40/0x50 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c151 el0_svc+0x54/0x14c arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c712 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x84/0xfc arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c730 el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S598 The following sequence led to the scenario - Userspace creates a VM and a vCPU. - The vCPU is initialized with KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 during KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT. - Without any other setup, such as vGIC or vPMU, userspace issues KVM_RUN on the vCPU. Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup, kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change(). As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before incrementing userspace_irqchip_in_use kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change() ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created) return -EINVAL if (ret) return ret [...] if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm)) static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use) - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again. Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON() kvm_timer_vcpu_reset() if (timer->enabled) kvm_timer_update_irq() if (!userspace_irqchip()) ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq() ret = vgic_lazy_init() if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm))) if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model != KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2) return -EBUSY WARN_ON(ret) Theoretically, since userspace_irqchip_in_uses functionality can be simply replaced by !irqchip_in_kernel(), get rid of the static key to avoid the mismanagement, which also helps with the syzbot issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** KVM
- **rootcause:** **Improper use of userspace_irqchip_in_use, userspace doesn't account for IRQ chip state**
- **vector:** KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 activation and userspace KVM_RUN
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **impact:** WARN_ON

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper use of the `userspace_irqchip_in_use` static key in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) implementation for the ARM64 architecture. This key is intended to track whether a userspace interrupt controller is in use, but its usage is flawed, leading to a race condition and a subsequent WARN_ON failure.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**

1.  **Incorrect `userspace_irqchip_in_use` Logic:** The static key `userspace_irqchip_in_use` is incremented in `kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()` when a vPMU (virtual Performance Monitoring Unit) is requested but not properly set up, and the function returns an error. Critically, the key is incremented *after* the timer is enabled, but *before* the function returns due to the vPMU setup failure. If userspace then attempts another initialization, this can lead to the static key being in an incorrect state, triggering a WARN\_ON in `kvm_timer_update_irq()`.
2.  **Race Condition:** The described sequence exposes a race between the vCPU initialization and KVM\_RUN. If a user issues KVM\_RUN before properly setting up a requested vPMU, the key might be incremented incorrectly, causing the system to enter a state where it assumes a userspace irqchip is in use when it is not.
3.  **Mismanagement of `userspace_irqchip_in_use`:** The usage of a static key to track a condition that can be reliably determined by checking `irqchip_in_kernel()` leads to unnecessary complexity and potential for errors. The static key is also decremented in `kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy()` but only if `vcpu_has_run_once(vcpu)` which leads to another potential mismatch in the static key state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic:** The immediate impact is a kernel `WARN_ON` failure that is hit by the syzbot, leading to a kernel panic/crash, which can cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Userspace Interaction:** The attack is triggered by a specific sequence of ioctl calls from userspace to the KVM subsystem.
*   **KVM API:** The specific ioctls involved include:
    *   `KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT` to initialize a vCPU with `KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3`.
    *   `KVM_RUN` to start the vCPU execution without proper vPMU setup.
    *   Potentially subsequent `KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT` calls if the error is ignored by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to use KVM API:** The attacker needs to be able to create VMs and vCPUs via the KVM API, using ioctl operations.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need root or other specific elevated privileges. This is because the vulnerability lies in the normal usage flow of the KVM API.

**More details than the CVE description:**

The provided content gives a detailed sequence of operations that lead to the WARN\_ON, which is more than a generic description. It also explains:

*   The exact code flow in the kernel that leads to the issue.
*   The flawed logic behind `userspace_irqchip_in_use`.
*   The specific functions where the static key is incremented/decremented.
*   How the static key is redundant.

The patch essentially removes the problematic `userspace_irqchip_in_use` static key and replaces its usage with direct checks against the function `irqchip_in_kernel()`. This eliminates the race condition and associated issues.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-393: Return of Wrong Status Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A function or operation returns an incorrect return value or status code that does not indicate an error, but causes the product to modify its behavior based on the incorrect result.

### Extended Description
This can lead to unpredictable behavior. If the function is used to make security-critical decisions or provide security-critical information, then the wrong status code can cause the product to assume that an action is safe, even when it is not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-684
ChildOf -> CWE-703

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary or resultant, but it is probably most often primary to other issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-1132:** DNS server returns wrong response code for non-existent AAAA record, which effectively says that the domain is inaccessible.
- **CVE-2001-1509:** Hardware-specific implementation of system call causes incorrect results from geteuid.
- **CVE-2001-1559:** Chain: System call returns wrong value (CWE-393), leading to a resultant NULL dereference (CWE-476).




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-733: Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the compiler optimizes the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.

### Extended Description

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1685:** C compiler optimization, as allowed by specifications, removes code that is used to perform checks to detect integer overflows.
- **CVE-2019-1010006:** Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage
- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap




## CWE-1342: Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The processor does not properly clear microarchitectural state after incorrect microcode assists or speculative execution, resulting in transient execution.

### Extended Description


In many processor architectures an exception, mis-speculation, or microcode assist results in a flush operation to clear results that are no longer required. This action prevents these results from influencing architectural state that is intended to be visible from software. However, traces of this transient execution may remain in microarchitectural buffers, resulting in a change in microarchitectural state that can expose sensitive information to an attacker using side-channel analysis. For example, Load Value Injection (LVI) [REF-1202] can exploit direct injection of erroneous values into intermediate load and store buffers.


Several conditions may need to be fulfilled for a successful attack:


  1. incorrect transient execution that results in remanence of sensitive information;

  1. attacker has the ability to provoke microarchitectural exceptions;

  1. operations and structures in victim code that can be exploited must be identified.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-1342 differs from CWE-1303, which is related to misprediction and biasing microarchitectural components, while CWE-1342 addresses illegal data flows and retention. For example, Spectre is an instance of CWE-1303 biasing branch prediction to steer the transient execution indirectly.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are closely analyzing this entry and others to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks. Additional investigation may include other weaknesses related to microarchitectural state. As a result, this entry might change significantly in CWE 4.10.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-0551:** Load value injection in some processors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to enable information disclosure via a side-channel with local access.




## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.

### Extended Description
Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.

**Reasons:**

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.


### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.
