  "description": "TopQuadrant TopBraid EDG stores external credentials insecurely. An authenticated attacker with file system access can read edg-setup.properites and obtain the secret to decrypt external passwords stored in edg-vault.properties. An authenticated attacker could gain file system access using a separate vulnerability such as CVE-2024-45745. At least version 7.1.3 is affected. Version 7.3 adds HashiCorp Vault integration that does not store external passwords locally.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-45744:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- TopQuadrant TopBraid EDG stores credentials for external services (like databases or other EDG instances) insecurely. Specifically, it stores the secret used to encrypt these external passwords in a file called `edg-setup.properties`. This file can be accessed by an authenticated attacker with file system access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format:** The primary vulnerability is that the password encryption key is stored in plaintext.\n- **Insecure Credential Storage:** External service credentials are encrypted but the key to decrypt them is stored in a way that is easily retrievable if an attacker gains filesystem access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Exposure of External Service Credentials:** An attacker who gains access to the `edg-setup.properties` file can decrypt the stored passwords. This allows them to gain access to other systems that EDG connects to like databases or external SPARQL endpoints.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability itself doesn't provide privilege escalation, it provides the means to potentially access other services that might have higher privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **File System Access:** An attacker needs access to the filesystem of the server running TopBraid EDG.\n- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of EDG, and possibly leverage a different vulnerability to obtain filesystem access (like CVE-2024-45745).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to TopBraid EDG.\n- **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files on the server where TopBraid EDG is deployed, specifically `edg-setup.properties` and `edg-vault.properties`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerable versions include at least version 7.1.3 and all versions before 8.0.1 that do not have Hashicorp vault integration\n- TopBraid EDG 7.3 introduces Hashicorp Vault integration, which provides secure storage and management of credentials. Using Hashicorp Vault is the recommended mitigation.\n-  The `edg-setup.properties` file contains the secret that allows decryption of the stored passwords located in `edg-vault.properties`.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Upgrade to TopQuadrant TopBraid EDG 8.0.1 and use the Hashicorp Vault integration.\n- For versions 7.3 and later, enable the Hashicorp Vault integration, which stores credentials securely.",

CWE-257 is a peer of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), but these are less relevant because the vulnerability involves storing a secret used for decrypting passwords, not hard-coding the password or cryptographic key itself. CWE-257 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), a Class-level CWE, which is also considered as a secondary candidate because it's a broader category that encompasses CWE-257. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a relevant CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 --|PEEROF| cwe259\n    cwe257 --|PEEROF| cwe321\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of external credentials**, leading to the **exposure of the secret to decrypt external passwords**, and finally resulting in the potential for an attacker to gain access to other systems.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-257 (**Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format**) - The secret to decrypt passwords is stored in `edg-setup.properties`.\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker with file system access can read `edg-setup.properties` and obtain the secret to decrypt external passwords stored in `edg-vault.properties`.\n3.  **Resulting Impact:** An attacker could use the decrypted passwords to access other systems connected to EDG.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The key phrase \"**insecure storage of external credentials**\" directly points to a weakness related to how credentials are handled. The content summary explicitly states that \"the password encryption key is stored in plaintext,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-257 (**Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format**).\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-257 being among the top candidates. The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-257 is a specific instance of the broader category CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**), but due to the specific details provided in the vulnerability description, CWE-257 is a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) was also considered, but CWE-257 is more specific because it directly refers to passwords and their storage format.\n\nThe final selection is based on a combination of direct evidence from the vulnerability description, supporting information from the CVE reference, and the relationship context provided by the CWE database. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
