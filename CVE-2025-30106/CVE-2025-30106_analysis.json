It is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), which is a more general CWE. CWE-1393 is the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1392,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default password** (CWE-1393). This allows an attacker to connect to the device's network and potentially **sniff network traffic**, which could lead to the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319), if the traffic contains such data and is not encrypted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the dashcam has **hardcoded default credentials** that cannot be changed. This directly aligns with CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password). The attacker's ability to sniff network traffic because of the **default password** could expose sensitive information if transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-1393 is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), indicating a more specific case of using default credentials. CWE-1393 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
