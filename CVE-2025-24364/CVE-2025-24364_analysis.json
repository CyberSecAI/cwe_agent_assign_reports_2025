  "description": "vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker with authenticated access to the vaultwarden admin panel can **execute arbitrary code** in the system. The attacker could then change some settings to use sendmail as mail agent but adjust the settings in such a way that it would use a shell command. It then also needed to craft a special favicon image which would have the commands embedded to run during for example sending a test email. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.",

The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating settings in the admin panel related to the mail agent, icon cache folder and sending test emails.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, potentially leading to a full system compromise. The CVSS score is 7.2.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have authenticated access to the Vaultwarden admin panel. The attack involves crafting a malicious image for the icon cache and sending a test email.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges and no user interaction.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version 1.33.0.\n\n**More Detail Than CVE Description**: This content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would, including a Proof of Concept (PoC) and the exact steps to reproduce the vulnerability.",

The application allows an authenticated user to modify settings in such a way that a shell command is executed when sending a test email. The **improper neutralization** of these settings allows an attacker to inject and **execute arbitrary commands** on the system. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability requires an authenticated user to access the admin panel. This suggests that while authentication exists, it might be **missing** for specific critical functions that allow modification of mail agent settings. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base-level CWE describing **OS Command Injection**. It is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output). CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, describes the secondary weakness, where access to sensitive functions is not adequately protected, allowing the attacker to configure the mail agent settings. The graph shows a clear parent-child relationship between CWE-78 and its parent classes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** or **improper privilege management** for critical functions in the admin panel. This allows an authenticated attacker to then **improperly neutralize special elements** when configuring the mail agent, leading to **OS Command Injection** and ultimately, **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to **execute arbitrary code** by manipulating mail agent settings. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this by stating the **root cause** as the ability for an attacker with authenticated access to **execute arbitrary code**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the ability to inject OS commands via the mail agent settings, leading to arbitrary code execution. The retriever results and graph relationships support this decision. The evidence clearly points to an **improper neutralization** issue, making CWE-78 the most appropriate primary CWE. The **missing authentication** aspect is captured by CWE-306.
