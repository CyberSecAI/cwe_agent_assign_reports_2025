## Vulnerability Description
vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker with authenticated access to the vaultwarden admin panel can **execute arbitrary code** in the system. The attacker could then change some settings to use sendmail as mail agent but adjust the settings in such a way that it would use a shell command. It then also needed to craft a special favicon image which would have the commands embedded to run during for example sending a test email. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** special favicon image
- **weakness:** **execute arbitrary code**
- **product:** vaultwarden
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution, execute arbitrary command, remote code execution
- **attacker:** authenticated attacker
- **version:** before 1.33.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content related to the specified CVE:

**Content from github.com_a8158a91_20250624_183956.html (stripped)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker with authenticated access to the Vaultwarden admin panel can execute arbitrary code in the system. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating settings in the admin panel related to the mail agent, icon cache folder and sending test emails.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, potentially leading to a full system compromise. The CVSS score is 7.2.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have authenticated access to the Vaultwarden admin panel. The attack involves crafting a malicious image for the icon cache and sending a test email.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges and no user interaction.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version 1.33.0.

**More Detail Than CVE Description**: This content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would, including a Proof of Concept (PoC) and the exact steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
