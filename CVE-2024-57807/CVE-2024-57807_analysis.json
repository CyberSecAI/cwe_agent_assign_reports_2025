CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) are related as potential causes of deadlocks. CWE-667 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-413 is a Base-level CWE. Since the description mentions a **circular locking dependency**, the more specific CWE-833 is a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe667\n    cwe667 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe413\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe413 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **circular locking dependency**, leading to **improper locking**, and ultimately resulting in a **deadlock**.\n\nCircular Locking Dependency -> Improper Locking -> Deadlock\n\nThe primary root cause is the circular dependency, which manifests as a deadlock.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the primary weakness, supported by the explicit mention of \"deadlock\" in the vulnerability description and the **circular locking dependency**. The retriever results also listed CWE-833 as a top candidate. The relationship analysis confirms this, as improper locking can lead to a deadlock. The selection of CWE-833 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the vulnerability's impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
