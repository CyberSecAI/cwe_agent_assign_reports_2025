## Vulnerability Description
WebAPI 2.8 and earlier for Perl uses the rand() function as the default source of entropy, which is **not cryptographically secure**, for cryptographic functions. Specifically WebAPI uses the DataRandom library which specifically states that it is Useful mostly for test programs. DataRandom uses the rand() function.
