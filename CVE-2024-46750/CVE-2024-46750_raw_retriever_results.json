Ironically pci_bus_reset(), several calls down from pci_reset_bus(), uses pci_bus_lock() before issuing the reset which locks everything *but* the bridge itself. For the same motivation as adding bridge = pci_upstream_bridge(dev) if (bridge) pci_dev_lock(bridge) to pci_reset_function() for the bus and cxl_bus reset cases, add pci_dev_lock() for @bus->self to pci_bus_lock().
