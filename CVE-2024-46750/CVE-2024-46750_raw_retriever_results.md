## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Add missing bridge lock to pci_bus_lock() One of the true positives that the cfg_access_lock lockdep effort identified is this sequence WARNING CPU 14 PID 1 at drivers/pci/pci.c4886 pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 RIP 0010pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 Call Trace ? __warn+0x8c/0x190 ? pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 ? report_bug+0x1f8/0x200 ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 pci_reset_bus+0x1d8/0x270 vmd_probe+0x778/0xa10 pci_device_probe+0x95/0x120 Where pci_reset_bus() users are triggering unlocked secondary bus resets. Ironically pci_bus_reset(), several calls down from pci_reset_bus(), uses pci_bus_lock() before issuing the reset which locks everything *but* the bridge itself. For the same motivation as adding bridge = pci_upstream_bridge(dev) if (bridge) pci_dev_lock(bridge) to pci_reset_function() for the bus and cxl_bus reset cases, add pci_dev_lock() for @bus->self to pci_bus_lock().
