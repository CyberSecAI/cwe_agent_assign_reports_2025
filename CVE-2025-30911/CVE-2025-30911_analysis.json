CWE-77 is a class-level CWE and represents command injection in general. CWE-74 is a more general class \"Injection\". CWE-78 is more specific because the content summary indicates OS command execution. CWE-94 is also a base-level CWE and could be considered a parent of CWE-78 since OS commands are code. The relationship indicates a progression from general injection to specific OS command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Injection\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Code Injection\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|IS_A| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of code generation**, leading to **command injection**. The chain progresses to remote code execution, allowing a malicious actor to execute commands on the target website and potentially gain full control.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)**.\nWeakness: **Command Injection**.\nImpact: Remote Code Execution, gaining backdoor access, and full website control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the description's explicit mention of \"**Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)**\" and \"**Command Injection**.\" The retriever results also highlighted CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) as strong candidates. The analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirmed that the vulnerability leads to remote code execution, where a malicious actor can execute commands on the target website.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and content summary strongly supports the selection of CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) as the primary CWE. This is further supported by the high retriever score for CWE-78 when its alternate terms are considered. CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is selected as a secondary CWE, since the **improper control of code generation** is the root cause that led to the **command injection**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and its impact. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the OS command injection vulnerability, while CWE-94 addresses the **improper control of code generation** that led to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant
