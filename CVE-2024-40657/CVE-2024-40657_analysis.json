It has child CWEs, but none seem to fit the description better. Other CWEs considered were privilege-related, due to the impact of privilege escalation. The relationships between CWE-441 and other related CWEs (like CWE-668 via CanPrecede) helped confirm its relevance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe1021[\"CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\"]\n    \n    cwe441 -->|PARENTOF| cwe918\n    cwe441 -->|PARENTOF| cwe1021\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe441 primary\n    class cwe918,cwe1021 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **confused deputy** situation in `addPreferencesForType of AccountTypePreferenceLoader.java`, leading to the ability to disable apps for other users, and ultimately results in local escalation of privilege.\n  - The **Primary CWE** is CWE-441, which identifies the **confused deputy** issue that led to the vulnerability i.e. the first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\"\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **confused deputy** vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**confused deputy**\" as the root cause. The evidence provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability stems from improper handling of external resources and missing validation of fragment attributes, further supporting the **confused deputy** scenario.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-441 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-269 was considered due to the impact of privilege escalation, but it's a discouraged CWE and focuses more on the impact than the root cause. The privilege guidance suggests that when a root cause can be determined, it is preferred over CWE-269.\n\nThe final selection is CWE-441, which is at the Class level and directly addresses the **confused deputy** weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
