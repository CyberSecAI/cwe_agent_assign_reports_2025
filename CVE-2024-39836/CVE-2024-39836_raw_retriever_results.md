## Query
Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.1, 9.5.x <= 9.5.7, 9.10.x <= 9.10.0 and 9.8.x <= 9.8.2 fail to ensure that remote/synthetic users cannot create sessions or reset passwords, which allows the munged email addresses, created by shared channels, to be used to receive email notifications and to reset passwords, when they are valid, functional emails.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper session', 'password reset validation'
