  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0103 Content\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2025-0103 as it is a security advisory (PAN-SA-2025-0001) from Palo Alto Networks detailing multiple vulnerabilities, including the one identified by CVE-2025-0103, in the Expedition migration tool. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nAn SQL injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL injection (CVE-2025-0103)\n*   Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) (CVE-2025-0104)\n*   Arbitrary file deletion (CVE-2025-0105)\n*   Wildcard expansion (CVE-2025-0106)\n*   OS command injection (CVE-2025-0107)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-0103:** An authenticated attacker can reveal Expedition database contents (password hashes, usernames, device configurations, device API keys). Attackers can also create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.\n*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user\u2019s browser, potentially leading to browser-session theft.\n*   **CVE-2025-0105:** An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files accessible to the www-data user.\n*   **CVE-2025-0106:** An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate files on the host filesystem.\n*   **CVE-2025-0107:** An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary OS commands as the www-data user, potentially disclosing sensitive information.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-0103:** Network, SQL injection. Requires authentication.\n*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Network, reflected XSS. Requires user interaction (clicking a malicious link).\n*   **CVE-2025-0105:** Network, arbitrary file deletion. No authentication required.\n*   **CVE-2025-0106:** Network, wildcard expansion. No authentication required.\n*   **CVE-2025-0107:** Network, OS command injection. No authentication required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-0103:** Authenticated attacker.\n*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Attacker capable of creating and distributing malicious links.\n*   **CVE-2025-0105, CVE-2025-0106, CVE-2025-0107:** No specific capabilities required, unauthenticated access is sufficient.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade Expedition to version 1.2.100 or later (fixes CVE-2025-0103, CVE-2025-0104, CVE-2025-0107).\n*   Upgrade Expedition to version 1.2.101 or later (fixes CVE-2025-0105, CVE-2025-0106).\n*   However, Expedition is End-of-Life (EoL) and no further updates are planned.\n*   **Workarounds:** Restrict network access to Expedition to authorized users/hosts/networks. Shut down Expedition if not actively in use.",
