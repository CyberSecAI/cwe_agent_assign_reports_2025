This can allow them to perform operations beyond their intended permissions.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a failure in the User Account and Authentication (UAA) component of Cloud Foundry to correctly remove a user from internal UAA groups when the user has been removed from the corresponding group in an external OIDC or SAML provider. UAA uses group mapping to convert groups from the external provider to groups in the UAA system. After the initial group conversion when a user first logs in, if the user is removed from a group in the external provider, the UAA system may not update the shadow user's internal group membership, causing the user to retain outdated access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Group Synchronization:** UAA fails to properly synchronize group memberships from an external OIDC or SAML provider to its internal shadow user representation after the initial login.\n*   **Outdated Access:** Users retain outdated access rights within the UAA system, even after these rights should have been revoked in the external system.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation/Incorrect Access:** Users may retain access to resources or functionalities within Cloud Foundry that they should no longer have access to, based on their current group memberships in the external authentication provider.\n*   **Security Risk:** The continued access poses a potential security risk, since users could gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **External Group Membership Changes:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user is removed from a group in an external OIDC or SAML provider.\n*   **User Login:** The user needs to log in to UAA after being removed from the group in the external provider for the outdated group membership to persist in UAA.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Direct Attacker Action Required**: The vulnerability manifests through normal operation of the system when external group memberships are modified and users subsequently login.\n*   **Access to External Identity Provider**: An attacker would not directly exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an administrator of the external OIDC or SAML provider would need to remove a user from a group and the user would subsequently have to log into UAA to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in UAA Release v77.10.0 and below.\n*   The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to UAA Release v77.11.0 or above.\n*   For existing users that might have outdated access due to this vulnerability, manual intervention may be required to remove the UAA shadow user via the UAA's user delete endpoint.\n*   The report credits @Rohit04061992 for reporting the vulnerability and @strehle for fixing it.",

CWE-266 is a base CWE which is more specific than class CWEs like CWE-863, but both apply to this vulnerability. The decision to classify it as CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is based on the fact that the **failure to properly synchronize users permissions** leads to users retaining access rights they should not have, which is an instance of incorrect privilege assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|PARENT OF| cwe266\n    cwe285 -->|PARENT OF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly synchronize users permissions**, which leads to users retaining access rights they should not have.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a **failure to properly synchronize users permissions**. The root cause is the incorrect assignment of privileges due to the synchronization failure between the external OIDC/SAML provider and the UAA. The impact is that users retain access rights they should not have, allowing them to perform operations beyond their intended permissions.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe mapping guidance helped clarify the distinction between privileges and permissions, leading to the selection of CWE-266 over other related CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-266:\nThe vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics as the UAA fails to remove users from internal groups when they are removed from corresponding groups in an external provider. This results in users retaining privileges they should not have. The security implication is unauthorized access to resources. This CWE is a base level CWE, directly addressing the root cause. The MITRE mapping guidance influenced the decision by emphasizing the importance of selecting the most specific base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness, and CWE-266 fits the vulnerability well.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-863:\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE that describes a situation where the product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. In this case, UAA **fails to properly synchronize users permissions**, leading to users retaining access rights. While this could be viewed as an authorization issue, the root cause is more specifically an incorrect privilege assignment. It is a less descriptive fit than CWE-266.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) were considered but deemed less appropriate. CWE-285 is too general and discouraged, while CWE-269 is also discouraged and often misused.",
