In this case, the vulnerability description indicates that a successful CSRF attack can lead to **SQL Injection (CWE-89)**, thus establishing a chain. The abstraction level of CWE-352 is Compound, while CWE-89 is Base. Choosing the Base level for SQL Injection provides specific details about the vulnerability, but the Compound level for CSRF accurately represents the combination of weaknesses involved in that type of attack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe89 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.
