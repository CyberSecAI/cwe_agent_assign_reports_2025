  "description": "When Bazel Plugin in intellij imports a project (either using import project or Auto import) the dialog for trusting the project is not displayed. This comes from the fact that both call the method ProjectBuilder.createProject which then calls ProjectManager.getInstance().createProject. This method, as its name suggests is intended to create a new project, not to import an existing one. We recommend upgrading to version 2024.06.04.0.2 or beyond for the IntelliJ, CLion and Android Studio Bazel plugins.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5899:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe Bazel IntelliJ plugin, when importing Bazel projects, was not displaying the \"trust project\" confirmation dialog, which is a standard security measure in IntelliJ. This dialog normally prompts users to explicitly trust the project before it's fully loaded, preventing potentially malicious code from automatically executing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nThe primary vulnerability is the **missing trust confirmation dialog**. This bypasses a key security feature of IntelliJ, which is designed to protect users from opening potentially untrusted or malicious projects.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nBy skipping the trust confirmation dialog, an attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious Bazel project. This could lead to arbitrary code execution by the plugin, which is designed to build and load code. The impact can range from data theft to full system compromise depending on what malicious code the attacker puts inside the project.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves distributing malicious Bazel projects to unsuspecting users through methods such as:\n- Email attachments.\n- Hosting on a malicious site and instructing users to import.\n- Supply chain attacks where the malicious project is disguised as a dependency or package that users trust.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to:\n1. Create a malicious Bazel project with embedded or linked malicious code that will be executed by the Bazel plugin upon opening.\n2. Persuade the victim to open the project in an affected version of the IntelliJ IDE, using a vulnerable version of the Bazel plugin.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability affects the Bazel plugin across IntelliJ, CLion, and Android Studio.\n- Patched versions are available (2024.06.04.0.2 or later) and should be installed to fix the issue.\n- A workaround is to ensure users know and trust the source of any Bazel project they open.\n- The severity of this vulnerability is considered \"Low,\" even though the impact could be severe, likely due to the reliance on social engineering or a user action to open the malicious project.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the generic placeholder CVE description.",
