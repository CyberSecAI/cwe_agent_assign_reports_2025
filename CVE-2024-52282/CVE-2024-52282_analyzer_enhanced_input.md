*   **Relates to CVE-2024-52282:** YES
*   **Extract:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** Helm Applications may have sensitive values leaked
    *   **Affected versions:** \>=2.8.0, <2.8.10; \>=2.9.0, <2.9.4
    *   **Impact:**  Users with `GET` access to the `Apps` Custom Resource Definition can read sensitive information in the Apps’ values.  Also leaks to auditing logs when audit level is 2 or above.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network, High Privileges Required, User interaction required
    *   **Root cause:**  Applications installed via Rancher Manager Apps Catalog store their Helm values directly into the `Apps` Custom Resource Definition.
    *   **Patches:** 2.8.10, 2.9.4
    *   **Mitigation:** Limit the amount of users who can get or list the Apps’ CRD. Additionally, the same applies to the auditing logs if the Rancher Manager has audit logs enabled and set to level 2 or above. After the upgrade, users are recommended to rotate passwords and secrets that may have been leaked while using the affected versions.
    *   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-52282
    *   **Severity:** Moderate
    *   **CVSS Score:** 6.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
