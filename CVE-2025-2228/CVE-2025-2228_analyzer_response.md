# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-2228

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: This is the root cause because the vulnerability lies in inserting sensitive information into data that is sent. |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE: This is a consequence of the primary weakness, where sensitive information is exposed due to its inclusion in sent data. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-201, is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that represents the impact of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201), which leads to the exposure of that information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).
  - The root cause is CWE-201, as the sensitive data is improperly included in the sent message.
  - The impact is CWE-200, representing the resulting exposure of that sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **Sensitive Information Exposure** as the primary **weakness**. The vulnerability lies in the `register_user` function of the Responsive Addons for Elementor Free Elementor Addons Plugin and Elementor Templates plugin for WordPress. Authenticated attackers can extract sensitive data, including usernames and passwords, from users who register via the Edit Login | Registration Form widget, provided the user opens the email notification. This aligns well with CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), because the root cause is that sensitive information is put into the sent email.

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the summary of the CVE Reference Links Content. The description clearly states the **impact** of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information. The CWE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "The code, specifically `class-login-register.php`, handles user login and registration. The code appears to be vulnerable to potential security issues related to insufficient input validation and sanitization, particularly around user-supplied data used in database queries and email generation." It is putting sensitive information into the email.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the relationship between the root cause and the impact. CWE-201 is the root cause, and CWE-200 is the impact.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-201 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred. The other candidate CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant because they either focused on authorization issues (CWE-285, CWE-863, CWE-306, CWE-425), which isn't the primary issue here, or they were too general (CWE-284).

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.
