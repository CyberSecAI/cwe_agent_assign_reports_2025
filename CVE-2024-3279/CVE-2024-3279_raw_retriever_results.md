# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-3279
## Query
An improper access control vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the import endpoint. This vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker, without an account in the application, to import their own database file, leading to the deletion or spoofing of the existing `anythingllm.db` file. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can serve malicious data to users or collect information about them. The vulnerability stems from the applications failure to properly restrict access to the data-import functionality, allowing unauthorized database manipulation.
