  "description": "The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order parameter of the /wp-json/watch-life-net/v1/comment/getcomments REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8484\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the 'order' parameter within the `/wp-json/watch-life-net/v1/comment/getcomments` REST API endpoint of the \"REST API TO MiniProgram\" WordPress plugin.\n- The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied input, and it does not adequately prepare the SQL query before executing it.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw, where an attacker can insert arbitrary SQL code into the database query.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin lacks proper input validation and escaping of the 'order' parameter, which is directly incorporated into the SQL query.\n- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not use prepared statements, which would help prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-provided data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, configuration details, or other confidential data.\n- **Potential for Data Modification/Deletion:** While the provided description primarily focuses on information disclosure, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often be extended to modify or delete data, depending on the database permissions and the attacker's capabilities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through a publicly accessible REST API endpoint (`/wp-json/watch-life-net/v1/comment/getcomments`).\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning no prior login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Special Privileges:** An attacker does not need any specific privileges or access to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker simply needs network access to the WordPress site and the ability to make HTTP requests to the REST API endpoint.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the REST API TO MiniProgram plugin up to and including 4.7.7.\n- No patch is currently available for the vulnerability. The recommendation is to uninstall the affected plugin until a patch is available.\n- The vulnerable code is located within the `ram-rest-comments-controller.php` file of the plugin.",
