    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected product **does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message** which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for **deserialization**. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the application to allocate exhaustive amounts of memory and subsequently create a partial denial of service condition. Successful exploitation is only possible in redundant Telecontrol Server Basic setups and only if the connection between the redundant servers has been disrupted.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
