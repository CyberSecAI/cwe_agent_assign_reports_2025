  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected product **does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message** which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for **deserialization**. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the application to allocate exhaustive amounts of memory and subsequently create a partial denial of service condition. Successful exploitation is only possible in redundant Telecontrol Server Basic setups and only if the connection between the redundant servers has been disrupted.",

This leads to allocating **excessive amounts of memory (CWE-789)** which then results in an **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **root cause** is the **improper validation of the length field (CWE-1284)**, which directly leads to the excessive memory allocation. The vulnerability description explicitly states the product **does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message** which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for **deserialization**. This is strong evidence for **CWE-1284**. The subsequent **excessive memory allocation (CWE-789)** directly results from this **lack of validation**. The **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** is the final impact, as the excessive memory allocation leads to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-1284** as the primary CWE is based on its precise match to the **root cause** and its allowance according to MITRE mapping guidance. While **CWE-20** is a parent, **CWE-1284** provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. **CWE-789** and **CWE-400** are consequences of the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
