## Vulnerability Description
The Form Vibes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the fv_export_data parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.10 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

- **product:** Form Vibes WordPress plugin
- **version:** up to and including 1.4.10
- **component:** fv_export_data parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### CVE-2024-5325
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Form Vibes WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `fv_export_data` parameter and a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and validate the `fv_export_data` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-supplied data is not adequately escaped or parameterized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL queries are not properly prepared to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow attackers to:
- **Extract Sensitive Information:** Gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Manipulate Data:** Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Compromise the Application:** In severe cases, it could lead to full compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `fv_export_data` parameter.
- It can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL code in the parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least Subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.
