CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection that occurs at the OS level. Choosing CWE-78 provides a more precise classification than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements** in a command, specifically at the OS level. This allows an attacker to inject commands that the system executes, leading to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) and potentially complete control of the website.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-77, given the description mentioning \"Command Injection\". However, upon closer examination of the vulnerability description and CVE details, it became clear that the injection specifically allows execution of OS commands, which aligns perfectly with CWE-78. The evidence includes the vulnerability title itself and the \"impact\" section of the CVE summary which states \"OS command execution\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the type of command injection and the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
