  "reference_content": "Root cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability lies in the `mutateMergeDeep` function within `@tanstack/form-core` version 0.35.0. It's susceptible to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of object merging, specifically allowing modification of the prototype chain via a crafted payload.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Prototype Pollution: An attacker can inject or modify properties on `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects in the application.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Denial of Service (DoS): At a minimum, the vulnerability can lead to DoS.\n- Potential for further injection attacks: If the polluted prototype properties propagate to sensitive Node.js APIs (like `exec` or `eval`), it could enable arbitrary code execution.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Supply a malicious payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `mutateMergeDeep` function.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is processed by the `mutateMergeDeep` function.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but implies that updating the library or sanitizing input data before passing it to `mutateMergeDeep` could mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the PoC and detailed explanation of impact.",

The vulnerability is caused by **prototype pollution** due to improper handling of object merging. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The impact of the vulnerability is Denial of Service (DoS), which falls under uncontrolled resource consumption. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1321, which is a Variant level weakness. CWE-1321 does not have any specified parent-child relationships in the provided data. However, it can lead to a denial of service, which is a form of resource consumption. Therefore, CWE-400 is included as a secondary impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321) due to improper handling of object merging, which leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly a **prototype pollution** vulnerability, which directly matches CWE-1321. The description explicitly states this, making it a strong match. The impact of this vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS), which is why CWE-400 is added as a secondary weakness representing the impact. The selection is based on the vulnerability description's root cause and impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
