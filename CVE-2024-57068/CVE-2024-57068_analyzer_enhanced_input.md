## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.mutateMergeDeep function of @tanstack/form-core v0.35.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** @tanstack/form-core
- **version:** v0.35.0
- **component:** lib.mutateMergeDeep function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the `mutateMergeDeep` function within `@tanstack/form-core` version 0.35.0. It's susceptible to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of object merging, specifically allowing modification of the prototype chain via a crafted payload.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Prototype Pollution: An attacker can inject or modify properties on `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects in the application.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS): At a minimum, the vulnerability can lead to DoS.
- Potential for further injection attacks: If the polluted prototype properties propagate to sensitive Node.js APIs (like `exec` or `eval`), it could enable arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- Supply a malicious payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `mutateMergeDeep` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is processed by the `mutateMergeDeep` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but implies that updating the library or sanitizing input data before passing it to `mutateMergeDeep` could mitigate the vulnerability.
