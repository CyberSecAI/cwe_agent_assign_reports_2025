It doesn't provide details *how* the ReDoS is triggered, only that it's possible.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**  The content doesn't specify the impact, but ReDoS typically leads to high CPU usage, potentially causing a denial of service. The github content mentions \"100% CPU usage\" in a related issue.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The content states the vulnerability can be executed \"without authentication,\" implying a network-based attack vector is possible.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, lowering the barrier to entry for attackers.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to the resolved firmware version. The table lists affected and resolved firmware versions for various GL.iNet models.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The content provides a list of affected GL.iNet models and the firmware versions that contain fixes.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Chuya Hayakawa and Ryo Kamino.\n*   This information is more detailed than a standard CVE description, as it lists specific affected products and firmware.",
