This directly corresponds to **CWE-121** (Stack-based Buffer Overflow).\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-121 as a potential match, along with its parent CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Since the description provides sufficient detail to pinpoint the stack-based nature of the overflow, **CWE-121** is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) were considered, but they do not accurately capture the specific nature of the vulnerability as a stack-based overflow. CWE-120 implies a buffer copy operation, which is not explicitly mentioned, and CWE-125 describes an out-of-bounds read, which is different from an overflow (write).\nThe decision to use CWE-121 is based on the explicit mention of \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. This makes CWE-121 the most accurate and specific representation of the **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: Does not describe stack-based overflow.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: Does not describe stack-based overflow.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
