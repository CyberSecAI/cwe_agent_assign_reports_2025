  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in TOTOLINK X6000R 9.4.0cu.852_20230719. This issue affects the function setSyslogCfg of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument rtLogServer leads to **command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7907:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a command injection and stack overflow flaw within the `FUN_00415aa4(setSyslogCfg)` function of the TOTOLINK X6000R router firmware (version V9.4.0cu.852_20230719). This function handles the configuration of syslog settings.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection:** The `rtLogServer` parameter within the `setSyslogCfg` function is vulnerable to command injection. This means that an attacker can inject malicious commands into this parameter, which will then be executed by the router's operating system.\n- **Stack Overflow:** The same function is also susceptible to a stack overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the input provided to the `rtLogServer` parameter is larger than the buffer allocated on the stack, leading to overwriting of stack data, and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system, gaining full control of the device.\n- Stack overflow can also lead to denial of service (DoS) or allow arbitrary code execution on the target device.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered via the `rtLogServer` parameter within the `setSyslogCfg` function, likely accessible through the router's web interface or API, via a call to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the router's web interface or API and manipulate the `rtLogServer` parameter to inject malicious code.\n- An attacker would need network access to the router's web interface to exploit this vulnerability.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |\n| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, which represents the root cause of the command injection vulnerability. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. The secondary CWE, CWE-121, is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), representing the stack overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper neutralization** of the `rtLogServer` argument, leading to **command injection** (CWE-78). Additionally, if the input is larger than expected, it can trigger a **stack overflow** (CWE-121).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is **command injection** (CWE-78) due to the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `rtLogServer` argument. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description and CVE summary, which explicitly states that the `rtLogServer` parameter is vulnerable to command injection. The presence of a stack overflow condition provides further evidence for the claim.\n\nCWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a strong candidate.\n\nI considered other CWEs, particularly those related to injection and input validation, such as CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), and CWE-22 (Path Traversal). However, these were not as relevant as CWE-78 because the vulnerability specifically involves the execution of OS commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
