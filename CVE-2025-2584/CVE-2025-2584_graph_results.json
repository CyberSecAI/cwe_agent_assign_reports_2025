  "query": "A vulnerability was found in WebAssembly wabt 1.0.36. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function BinaryReaderInterpGetReturnCallDropKeepCount of the file wabt/src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
