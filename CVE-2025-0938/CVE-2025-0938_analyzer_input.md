# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0938

## Vulnerability Description
The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isnt valid according to RFC 3986. Square brackets are only meant to be used as delimiters for specifying IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts in URLs. This could result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other specification-compliant URL parsers.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **accepted domain names with square brackets**
- **impact:** differential parsing
- **component:** Python standard library functions urllib.parse.urlsplit and urlparse
