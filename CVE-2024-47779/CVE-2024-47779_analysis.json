  "description": "Element is a Matrix web client built using the Matrix React SDK .Element Web versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Note that despite superficial similarity to CVE-2024-47771, this is an entirely separate vulnerability, caused by a separate piece of code included only in Element Web. Element Web and Element Desktop share most but not all, of their code and this vulnerability exists in the part of the code base which is not shared between the projects. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue. As a workaround, avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47779:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from how Element Web handles media requests through its service worker, specifically when interacting with untrusted widgets. The service worker intercepts media download and thumbnail requests and attempts to add an access token to the request. The vulnerability occurs when retrieving and utilizing the access token in the service worker for these media requests.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   **Access Token Exposure:** The primary weakness is the potential exposure of the access token to malicious third parties under specific conditions. This is achieved by exploiting the media request interception logic in the service worker.\n-   **Improper Widget Handling:** The vulnerability is linked to how untrusted widgets are handled, suggesting a lack of sufficient isolation or permission controls for widgets.\n-   **Service Worker Logic:** The service worker\u2019s logic for fetching and using the access token for media requests had a flaw, which could be exploited.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Access Token Theft:**  A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to obtain the user's access token.\n-  **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen access token, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account and resources. The level of access is dependent on the permissions associated with the token.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **Malicious Widgets:** One identified vector involves the use of malicious widgets that can trigger the vulnerable code path within the service worker during media requests. Although other vectors may exist they are not explicitly specified.\n-   **Network Interception (Speculative):** Though not explicitly stated, a network attacker might try to manipulate the media requests to trigger the vulnerability if the service worker logic is predictable, though this is less likely given the service worker context.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Ability to Create/Inject Malicious Widgets:** An attacker needs to be able to create or inject a malicious widget that is then loaded into a vulnerable Element Web client.\n-  **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with or trigger the malicious widget for the exploit to occur. This is indicated by the \"UI:R\" (User Interaction Required) in the CVSS score.\n-   **Basic Network access:** The attack occurs over network requests from the client to the homeserver.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n-   The vulnerability is specific to Element Web and does not affect Element Desktop.\n-  The fix involves changes in `src/serviceworker/index.ts` and `src/vector/platform/WebPlatform.ts`. These changes seem to focus on correcting how access tokens and homeserver data are retrieved in the service worker.\n- The provided commit fixes the access token exposure. The commit diff shows that the fix refactors how the service worker retrieves the access token and home server information using postMessage to communicate with the main application window, ensuring correct access to local storage and avoiding the vulnerability.\n- CVSS scores for end-to-end encryption and without it are provided, indicating that with encryption the impact on confidentiality is considered lower (C:L) and without it, higher (C:H).",

The relationship indicates a focus on untrusted sources influencing web functionality. The secondary CWE, CWE-200, captures the impact of exposed sensitive information (access token).

The primary driver for CWE selection came from the description's focus on **untrusted widgets** leading to **access token exposure**.\n\nCWE-830 (Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability arises from the inclusion and handling of untrusted widgets. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"malicious widgets\" as the vector and \"avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets\" as a workaround. This directly aligns with CWE-830, which focuses on the risks associated with incorporating functionality from untrusted sources in web applications.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is included as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of the access token. This exposure is a direct consequence of the **improper handling of untrusted widgets**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how CWE-830 can lead to CWE-200.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication): Although authentication and authorization are related to access control, the core issue is not a failure in authentication or authorization logic itself, but rather the inclusion of untrusted code. Therefore these are not used.\n*   CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere): While the access token is exposed to the \"wrong sphere,\" CWE-830 provides a more specific root cause, making it a better fit.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This CWE is similar to CWE-200 but focuses more on the *insertion* of sensitive data, rather than the general *exposure*. Given the description, the issue is how the access token is handled when untrusted widgets are involved, not necessarily its insertion into data streams.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.

Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged",
