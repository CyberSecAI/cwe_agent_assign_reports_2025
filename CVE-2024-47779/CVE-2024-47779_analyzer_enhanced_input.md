## Vulnerability Description
Element is a Matrix web client built using the Matrix React SDK .Element Web versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Note that despite superficial similarity to CVE-2024-47771, this is an entirely separate vulnerability, caused by a separate piece of code included only in Element Web. Element Web and Element Desktop share most but not all, of their code and this vulnerability exists in the part of the code base which is not shared between the projects. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue. As a workaround, avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access token exposure
- **vector:** malicious widgets
- **attacker:** third parties
- **product:** Element Web
- **version:** 1.11.70 through 1.11.80

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Element Web handles media requests through its service worker, specifically when interacting with untrusted widgets. The service worker intercepts media download and thumbnail requests and attempts to add an access token to the request. The vulnerability occurs when retrieving and utilizing the access token in the service worker for these media requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Access Token Exposure:** The primary weakness is the potential exposure of the access token to malicious third parties under specific conditions. This is achieved by exploiting the media request interception logic in the service worker.
-   **Improper Widget Handling:** The vulnerability is linked to how untrusted widgets are handled, suggesting a lack of sufficient isolation or permission controls for widgets.
-   **Service Worker Logic:** The service worker’s logic for fetching and using the access token for media requests had a flaw, which could be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Access Token Theft:**  A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to obtain the user's access token.
-  **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen access token, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account and resources. The level of access is dependent on the permissions associated with the token.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Widgets:** One identified vector involves the use of malicious widgets that can trigger the vulnerable code path within the service worker during media requests. Although other vectors may exist they are not explicitly specified.
-   **Network Interception (Speculative):** Though not explicitly stated, a network attacker might try to manipulate the media requests to trigger the vulnerability if the service worker logic is predictable, though this is less likely given the service worker context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Create/Inject Malicious Widgets:** An attacker needs to be able to create or inject a malicious widget that is then loaded into a vulnerable Element Web client.
-  **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with or trigger the malicious widget for the exploit to occur. This is indicated by the "UI:R" (User Interaction Required) in the CVSS score.
-   **Basic Network access:** The attack occurs over network requests from the client to the homeserver.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability is specific to Element Web and does not affect Element Desktop.
-  The fix involves changes in `src/serviceworker/index.ts` and `src/vector/platform/WebPlatform.ts`. These changes seem to focus on correcting how access tokens and homeserver data are retrieved in the service worker.
- The provided commit fixes the access token exposure. The commit diff shows that the fix refactors how the service worker retrieves the access token and home server information using postMessage to communicate with the main application window, ensuring correct access to local storage and avoiding the vulnerability.
- CVSS scores for end-to-end encryption and without it are provided, indicating that with encryption the impact on confidentiality is considered lower (C:L) and without it, higher (C:H).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
