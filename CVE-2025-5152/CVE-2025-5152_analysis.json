  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Chanjet CRM up to 20250510. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /activity/newActivityedit.php?DontCheckLogin=1&id=null&ret=mod1. The manipulation of the argument gblOrgID leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

This directly corresponds to CWE-89, which is \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\". The description aligns precisely with the definition of CWE-89, where externally-influenced input is used to construct an SQL command without proper neutralization of special elements. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), but these are not applicable because the vulnerability is specifically an SQL injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
