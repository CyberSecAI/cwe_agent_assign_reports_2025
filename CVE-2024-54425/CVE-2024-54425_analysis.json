The specific impact varies case by case, but could include unauthorized changes to site settings or other administrative functions.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious request that is triggered by an authenticated user.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to initiate a crafted request, such as by tricking them into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.",
