  "query": "Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.",
