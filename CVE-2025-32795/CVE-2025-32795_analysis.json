  "description": "Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are **improperly granted permissions** to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.",

It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nNormal users were improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions, and icons in the DIFY application.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nInsecure User Role Access Control. Specifically, lack of proper permission checks allowing non-admin users to modify app details.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nCompromises the integrity and security of the application. Unauthorized modifications can lead to data corruption, misrepresentation, and potential exploitation.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn authenticated normal user could modify app details via the following endpoints:\n* /console/api/apps/{app.id}\n* /console/api/apps/{app.id}/name\n* /console/api/apps/{app.id}/icon\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn authenticated normal user. No special privileges are required beyond standard user login.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nUpdate access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions. Restrict normal users from performing edit actions on apps. Implement and review role-based access controls (RBAC). The pull request #5266 addresses this by:\n* Hiding the tag editor, App Info dropdown panel, and FireCrawl settings for Viewers and Editors.\n* Securing the app name and icon editing APIs to require at least Editor permissions.\n* Securing the workflow APIs to require at least Editor permissions.",

While it's generally preferred to map to Base-level CWEs, the description clearly states that the application performs authorization checks, but they are implemented incorrectly. This aligns well with CWE-863. CWE-266, \"Incorrect Privilege Assignment,\" is a Base-level CWE and a child of a higher-level Class CWE. It is added as a secondary CWE because it is about assigning privileges to a particular actor incorrectly, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improperly granted permissions** (CWE-266 and CWE-863), leading to the ability for non-admin users to modify app details. The final impact is a compromise of the integrity and security of the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both point to an authorization issue. The key phrase \"**improperly granted permissions**\" is crucial.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" as the top candidate, which is a good match. CWE-862, \"Missing Authorization,\" was also considered but deemed less appropriate because the application *does* perform authorization checks, but these checks are flawed, therefore it is an **incorrect authorization**. CWE-266, \"Incorrect Privilege Assignment\" was also considered as the normal users were **improperly granted permissions** to edit app details.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-863 is further supported by the CWE Classification Guidance which states: \"CWE-863: *Incorrect Authorization* \u2013 the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).\" The fact that non-admin users could modify app details despite supposedly being restricted from doing so indicates a flaw in the authorization logic. CWE-266 captures that the normal users were assigned privileges that allowed them to edit app details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
