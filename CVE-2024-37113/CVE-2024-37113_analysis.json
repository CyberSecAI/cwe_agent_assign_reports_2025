CWE-359 is a more specific case of CWE-200, focusing on private personal information. Given the vulnerability description mentions \"sensitive information,\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states \"A malicious actor can view sensitive information that is normally not available to regular users,\" CWE-200 is a suitable starting point. If the sensitive information is determined to be private personal information, then CWE-359 would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** that allows **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, which could then allow for other vulnerabilities to be exploited.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" and \"A malicious actor can view sensitive information that is normally not available to regular users\". This aligns directly with CWE-200, which is defined as \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while discouraged, is reasonable because the kind of sensitive data is not specified. CWE-359, \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\", is also relevant because the description could involve private personal information. The retriever results list CWE-359 with a high score also.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 as the primary CWE because the description uses the generic term \"sensitive information\". I am also including CWE-359 as a possible secondary CWE, in case the sensitive information is indeed private and personal.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity

If the sensitive information is determined to be private personal information, then CWE-359 would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** that allows **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, which could then allow for other vulnerabilities to be exploited.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" and \"A malicious actor can view sensitive information that is normally not available to regular users\". This aligns directly with CWE-200, which is defined as \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while discouraged, is reasonable because the kind of sensitive data is not specified. CWE-359, \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\", is also relevant because the description could involve private personal information. The retriever results list CWE-359 with a high score also.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 as the primary CWE because the description uses the generic term \"sensitive information\". I am also including CWE-359 as a possible secondary CWE, in case the sensitive information is indeed private and personal.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
