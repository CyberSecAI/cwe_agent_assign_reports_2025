  "query": "The Chef Habitat builder-api on-prem-builder package with any version lower than habitat/builder-api/10315/20240913162802 is vulnerable to indirect object reference (IDOR) by un-authorized deletion of personal token. Habitat builder consumes builder-api habitat package as a dependency and the vulnerability was specifically due to builder-api habitat package. The fix was made available in habitat/builder-api/10315/20240913162802 and all the subsequent versions after that. We would recommend user to always use on-prem stable channel.",
