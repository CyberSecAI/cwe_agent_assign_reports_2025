# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38597
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved eth sungem remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks Erhard reports netpoll warnings from sungem netpoll_send_skb_on_dev() eth0 enabled interrupts in poll (gem_start_xmit+0x0/0x398) WARNING CPU 1 PID 1 at net/core/netpoll.c370 netpoll_send_skb+0x1fc/0x20c gem_poll_controller() disables interrupts, which may sleep. We cant sleep in netpoll, it has interrupts disabled completely. Strangely, gem_poll_controller() doesnt even poll the completions, and instead acts as if an interrupt has fired so it just schedules NAPI and exits. None of this has been necessary for years, since netpoll invokes NAPI directly.
