## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter Visualization V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.14), Teamcenter Visualization V2312 (All versions < V2312.0010), Teamcenter Visualization V2406 (All versions < V2406.0008), Teamcenter Visualization V2412 (All versions < V2412.0004), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0013). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure** while parsing specially crafted WRL files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
