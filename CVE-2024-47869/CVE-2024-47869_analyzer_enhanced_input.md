## Vulnerability Description
Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a ****timing attack**** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to mitigate this issue. To mitigate the risk before applying the patch, developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time comparison** function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access to the analytics dashboard can be disabled.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **timing attack**
- **impact:** unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard
- **product:** Gradio
- **version:** before 4.44
- **component:** analytics_dashboard function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Non-constant-time comparison of hashes in the `analytics_dashboard` function within the Gradio library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Timing attack vulnerability due to the non-constant time hash comparison. This allows an attacker to infer the correct hash by observing the response time of requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard.
- **Attack vectors:** By measuring the response time of different requests with varying keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to repeatedly query the system with different keys. They do not need prior authentication other than the ability to send requests.
