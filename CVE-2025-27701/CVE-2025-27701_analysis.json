The **failure to check** for this **NULL** value before dereferencing `ptrs[i]` leads to a **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476). This can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) and information disclosure, as described in the vulnerability description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the `ptrs[i]` value can be **NULL** and is later dereferenced without a **NULL** check. This directly corresponds to CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The description also mentions a potential out-of-bounds read and information disclosure as potential consequences, which aligns with CWE-125.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"the values of ptrs[i] can be potentially equal to NULL which is valid value after calling slice_map_array().

The other suggested CWEs, such as CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value) and CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), are not as directly relevant to the described vulnerability.
