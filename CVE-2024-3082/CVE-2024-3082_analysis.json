Several other CWEs were considered, especially those related to storage of sensitive information, but CWE-256 was the most specific and directly matched the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: the administrative account password is stored in plaintext (CWE-256), allowing an attacker with physical access to retrieve it and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states the **rootcause** as **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"The password for the administrative account is stored in plaintext, which is a CWE-256 vulnerability.\" This direct evidence leads to a high confidence in the mapping.
