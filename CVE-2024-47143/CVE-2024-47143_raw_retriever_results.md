# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47143
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dma-debug fix a possible deadlock on radix_lock radix_lock() shouldnt be held while holding dma_hash_entry[idx].lock otherwise, theres a possible deadlock scenario when dma debug API is called holding rq_lock() CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 dma_free_attrs() check_unmap() add_dma_entry() __schedule() //out (A) rq_lock() get_hash_bucket() (A) dma_entry_hash check_sync() (A) radix_lock() (W) dma_entry_hash dma_entry_free() (W) radix_lock() // CPU2s one (W) rq_lock() CPU1 situation can happen when it extending radix tree and it tries to wake up kswapd via wake_all_kswapd(). CPU2 situation can happen while perf_event_task_sched_out() (i.e. dma sync operation is called while deleting perf_event using etm and etr tmc which are Arm Coresight hwtracing driver backends). To remove this possible situation, call dma_entry_free() after put_hash_bucket() in check_unmap().
