  "description": "Logsign Unified SecOps Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the web service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The issue results from the **lack of proper implementation of the authentication algorithm**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25336.",
