CWE-201 is selected as the primary because the **sensitive information** is being exposed. CWE-639 and CWE-863 are related to authorization issues and could be secondary issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an authorization issue where a user with Contributor-level access can access the `dpp_duplicate_as_draft` function. This function then leads to **Sensitive Information Exposure** because it allows the attacker to extract potentially **sensitive data** from draft, scheduled, private, and password-protected posts. The root cause is the **sensitive information exposure** as a result of the function being accessible.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description which mentions \"**Sensitive Information Exposure**\" and the ability to \"extract potentially **sensitive data**\". This aligns directly with CWE-201. The graph relationships helped to consider other possible related CWEs such as CWE-639 and CWE-863, both of which related to authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity. CWE-201 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-639 and CWE-863 are also considered as secondary candidates due to the authorization aspect of the vulnerability, where contributors are able to access the function.\n\nRelevant CWE
