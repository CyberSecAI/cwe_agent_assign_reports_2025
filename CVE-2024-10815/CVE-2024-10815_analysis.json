  "reference_content": "## CVE-2024-10815 Analysis\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-10815. It details a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PostLists plugin for WordPress. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it in an attribute.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser. The CVSS score is 4.2 (Medium).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL and tricking an administrator into visiting it. Example URL: `https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=postlists&cow=<script>alert(5)</script>`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and deliver it to a logged-in administrator. The vulnerability is triggered in older web browsers that do not encode characters.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nAs of the provided information, there is **no known fix** available.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Plugin:** PostLists <= 2.0.2\n*   **Proof of Concept:** Provided a specific URL to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   **References:**\n    *   CVE: [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10815](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10815)\n    *   OWASP Top 10: A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    *   CWE: CWE-79\n    *   CVSS: [https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)\n*   **Researcher:** Bob Matyas ([https://www.bobmatyas.com](https://www.bobmatyas.com), [https://twitter.com/bobmatyas](https://twitter.com/bobmatyas))\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published and added on 2024-12-19.\n*   **WPVDB ID:** 309a445a-6261-4bd1-bac0-a78096d0c12b",

The plugin does not neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in output, leading to XSS. |\n| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves outputting data without proper encoding/escaping. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-79, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-116, a Class level CWE, was considered as a secondary candidate.\n- CWE-79 is a base CWE that is parent of several more specific CWEs related to XSS.\n- CWE-116 is a Class CWE that might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe116\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following sequence:\n1.  The PostLists WordPress plugin receives input from the `$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]` parameter.\n2.  The plugin fails to neutralize this input before outputting it in an attribute.\n3.  This leads to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which includes a detailed description of the vulnerability and its root cause. The key phrase, \"**weakness: cross-site scripting**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section confirms that the vulnerability is an XSS issue. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states, \"The plugin does not escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it in an attribute,\" pinpointing the **root cause** as a **missing** output encoding/escaping.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-79 as the best candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization of input** during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\nCWE-116 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because while it involves improper encoding/escaping of output, it is a class-level CWE. CWE-79 directly describes the XSS vulnerability resulting from the lack of neutralization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
