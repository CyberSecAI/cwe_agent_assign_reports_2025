  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3622 Content\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability report concerning the `xorbitsai/inference` project on GitHub. It is **RELATED** to a potential security issue. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from using `torch.load` without the `weights_only=True` parameter when deserializing model state dictionaries from potentially untrusted files (`llm_model`, `flow_model`, `hift_model`). This allows for arbitrary code execution if the files contain malicious pickle data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Specifically, the unsafe use of `torch.load` without proper safeguards.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the file paths used for loading models, making it easier for an attacker to supply malicious files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Potential for gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n*   **Data Leakage:** Risk of sensitive data being leaked.\n*   **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the system is possible.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can create malicious pickle files disguised as model state dictionaries.\n*   The attacker can then manipulate the system to load these malicious files using the vulnerable `load` method. This could involve replacing legitimate model files with the malicious ones.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the file paths used by the `load` method. This could involve file system access or the ability to control environment variables.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious pickle files containing executable code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Add the `weights_only=True` parameter to all `torch.load` calls within the `load` method.  Example:\n    ```\n    self.llm.load_state_dict(torch.load(llm_model, map_location=self.device, weights_only=True), strict=True)\n    ```\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability is located in `xinference/thirdparty/cosyvoice/cli/model.py` at lines L61C1-L72C1.\n*   The report includes a detailed reproduction process, outlining how to create malicious files and exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The issue is labeled as \"stale\" on GitHub, suggesting it may not be actively addressed.\n*   The issue is associated with milestone `v1.x`.\n*   The report provides information about the system environment (Docker, pip install, source installation) but states the vulnerability isn't version-specific.",

The vulnerability stems from using `torch.load` without the `weights_only=True` parameter when deserializing model state dictionaries from potentially untrusted files, leading to arbitrary code execution. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data), which is a Base level CWE. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influence the selection in this specific case, as the vulnerability is directly attributable to the insecure deserialization process. While other CWEs like CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) could be a consequence of CWE-502, the root cause is the deserialization itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe502\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data via `torch.load` without `weights_only=True` (CWE-502). This leads to the potential for arbitrary code execution (CWE-94 as a consequence).\n\nCWE-502 (Root Cause) -> CWE-94 (Potential Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary, which clearly indicate that the root cause is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data.\n\nEvidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **deserialization**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from using `torch.load` without the `weights_only=True` parameter when deserializing model state dictionaries from potentially untrusted files (`llm_model`, `flow_model`, `hift_model`).
