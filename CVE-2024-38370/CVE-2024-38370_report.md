## Vulnerability Chain
There is no vulnerability chain to map because the provided advisory is invalid and contains no information about a real vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The provided information indicates that the GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-xrm2-m72w-w4x4) for the GLPI project was published in error and does not represent a real vulnerability. The advisory itself states "This advisory has been published by error, it will be removed; sorry for the inconvenience." and "No CWEs", further reinforcing that no vulnerability exists.

Since there is no actual vulnerability described, I cannot assign any CWEs. My assessment is entirely based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states the advisory is an error and contains no information about a vulnerability. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is NOINFO.
