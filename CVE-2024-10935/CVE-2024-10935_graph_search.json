This flaw can be exploited by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters at the end of the boundary, leading to excessive resource consumption and a complete denial of service (DoS) for all users. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user login or interaction is required for an attacker to exploit this issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1284 CWE-130 CWE-400 CWE-444 CWE-770 CWE-113 CWE-401 CWE-790 CWE-1333",
