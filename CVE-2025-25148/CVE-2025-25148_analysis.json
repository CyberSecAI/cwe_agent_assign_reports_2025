It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The content doesn't specify the exact root cause within the plugin's code, only that it's susceptible to CSRF attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. An attacker crafts a malicious request that is executed by an authenticated user.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious request (e.g., through a phishing link or malicious website).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 3, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n*   The report suggests the severity is low and exploitation is unlikely.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** WordPress Read More Copy Link Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.2\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **PSID:** 1ff607b8f43b\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack",

CWE-352 is a compound weakness. The analysis also considered the relationship that CWE-79 can be caused by **improper** neutralization of user input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352). Successful exploitation of CSRF can then lead to Stored **XSS** (CWE-79) because the attacker can trick the user into submitting malicious input that gets stored and executed in the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" leading to \"Stored **XSS**\". The **ROOTCAUSE** is the **CSRF**, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge or consent. This can lead to **XSS** if the attacker uses the **CSRF** vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the application.\n\nThe primary assignment is CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] because the initial **ROOTCAUSE** is the lack of **sufficient verification** of the request's origin. The Stored **XSS** is a consequence of the **CSRF** vulnerability, making CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] a secondary weakness.\n\nCWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a compound CWE, and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a base CWE. The selection of these CWEs is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the relationships between them.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
