It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The content doesn\\'t specify the exact root cause within the plugin\\'s code, only that it\\'s susceptible to CSRF attacks.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. An attacker crafts a malicious request that is executed by an authenticated user.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious request (e.g., through a phishing link or malicious website).\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 3, 2025).\\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\\n*   The report suggests the severity is low and exploitation is unlikely.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Software:** WordPress Read More Copy Link Plugin\\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.2\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\\n*   **PSID:** 1ff607b8f43b\\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:ElbowRobo Read More Copy Link', 'keyphrase': 'ElbowRobo Read More Copy Link', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0.2', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(311.8103715367154)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
