## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Shiprocket Module 3 on OpenCart. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /index.php?route=extension/module/rest_api&action=getOrders of the component REST API Module. The manipulation of the argument contentHash leads to **incorrect authorization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **incorrect authorization**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument contentHash
- **product:** Shiprocket Module
- **version:** 3
- **component:** REST API Module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0580 based on provided content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-0580, and provides more detail than the placeholder description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic error and type confusion in the PHP authentication code of the ShipRocket OpenCart Rest API module. Specifically, the code uses the loosely typed comparison operator `==` instead of the strictly typed `===` when comparing the expected hash (`$hash`) with the hash provided in the `x-hash` header (`$contentHash`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The authentication mechanism is flawed, allowing bypass with a simple manipulation of HTTP headers.
*   **Authentication Bypass (CAPEC-115):** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to sensitive data and potentially modify the database.
*   **Type Confusion:** PHP's type juggling combined with the loose comparison operator allows an empty string to be considered equal to `null`, bypassing the authentication check.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An unauthenticated attacker can access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive information stored in the site's database. It may also be possible to make changes to the site's database. The example provided shows retrieval of full order details, including customer information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending a crafted HTTP request to the module's endpoint (e.g., `/index.php?route=extension/module/rest_api&action=getOrders`) with:
    *   An arbitrary value for the `x-public` header.
    *   An empty value for the `x-hash` header (e.g., `x-hash: ` or omitting the header entirely).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenCart instance. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Check for the presence and validity of both `x-public` and `x-hash` headers.
*   If no hash match is found in the database, return immediately or set `$hash` to `FALSE`.
*   Use the strictly typed comparison operator `===` instead of `==` to avoid type confusion errors.

**CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N 8.2 High

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
