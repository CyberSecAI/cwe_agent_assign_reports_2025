  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Shiprocket Module 3 on OpenCart. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /index.php?route=extension/module/rest_api&action=getOrders of the component REST API Module. The manipulation of the argument contentHash leads to incorrect authorization. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
