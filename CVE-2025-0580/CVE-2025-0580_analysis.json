  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Shiprocket Module 3 on OpenCart. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /index.php?route=extension/module/rest_api&action=getOrders of the component REST API Module. The manipulation of the argument contentHash leads to **incorrect authorization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0580 based on provided content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-0580, and provides more detail than the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a logic error and type confusion in the PHP authentication code of the ShipRocket OpenCart Rest API module. Specifically, the code uses the loosely typed comparison operator `==` instead of the strictly typed `===` when comparing the expected hash (`$hash`) with the hash provided in the `x-hash` header (`$contentHash`).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The authentication mechanism is flawed, allowing bypass with a simple manipulation of HTTP headers.\n*   **Authentication Bypass (CAPEC-115):** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to sensitive data and potentially modify the database.\n*   **Type Confusion:** PHP's type juggling combined with the loose comparison operator allows an empty string to be considered equal to `null`, bypassing the authentication check.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn unauthenticated attacker can access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive information stored in the site's database. It may also be possible to make changes to the site's database. The example provided shows retrieval of full order details, including customer information.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending a crafted HTTP request to the module's endpoint (e.g., `/index.php?route=extension/module/rest_api&action=getOrders`) with:\n    *   An arbitrary value for the `x-public` header.\n    *   An empty value for the `x-hash` header (e.g., `x-hash: ` or omitting the header entirely).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenCart instance. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Check for the presence and validity of both `x-public` and `x-hash` headers.\n*   If no hash match is found in the database, return immediately or set `$hash` to `FALSE`.\n*   Use the strictly typed comparison operator `===` instead of `==` to avoid type confusion errors.\n\n**CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N 8.2 High",

CWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\", is considered as a secondary candidate because while the authorization is incorrect, it might stem from a lack of proper initial authentication. CWE-639, \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\", is related because the `contentHash` argument is being manipulated to bypass authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** in the REST API module due to the manipulation of the `contentHash` argument. This leads to potential access to sensitive information and modification of the database.\n\n1.  **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The primary weakness.\n2.  Potential **Missing Authentication (CWE-306):** If authentication is completely missing, it exacerbates the authorization issue.\n3.  **Authorization Bypass (CWE-639):** Manipulation of the `contentHash` allows bypassing authorization checks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified **incorrect authorization** as the primary weakness. The provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this, detailing how the use of loose comparison operators (`==` instead of `===`) leads to authentication bypass. The retriever results also highlight CWE-863 as a potential candidate. While CWE-306 and CWE-639 were considered, the presence of an authentication mechanism (however flawed) makes CWE-863 the most accurate primary classification. CWE-306 and CWE-639 are considered secondary candidates.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"The vulnerability stems from a logic error and type confusion in the PHP authentication code... Specifically, the code uses the loosely typed comparison operator `==` instead of the strictly typed `===` when comparing the expected hash (`$hash`) with the hash provided in the `x-hash` header (`$contentHash`).\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
