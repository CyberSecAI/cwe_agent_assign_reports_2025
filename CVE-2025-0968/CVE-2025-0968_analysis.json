While the root cause is the missing authorization, the direct consequence is information exposure. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**missing capability checks**\", CWE-862 is more appropriate than the more general CWE-284. CWE-863 is not appropriate because the vulnerability is due to a **missing** check, not an incorrect one. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) represents the impact of the missing authorization, forming a chain relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability checks** (CWE-862), which leads to the **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200). The unauthenticated attacker can then view sensitive information such as posts, pages, and templates, including drafts, trashed, and private items.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 as the primary root cause due to the explicit mention of \"**missing capability checks**\" in the vulnerability description. This is further supported by the description of the get_megamenu_content() function lacking authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass access controls. The secondary weakness, CWE-200, is a direct result of the **missing authorization**, leading to information exposure. The relationship analysis clarifies that CWE-862 is a specific type of improper access control (CWE-284) and that the missing authorization can lead to information exposure. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 being a Class-level CWE that accurately represents the **missing authorization** and CWE-200 representing the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization):** This CWE accurately describes the root cause where the application **fails to perform an authorization check** before granting access to a resource.\n*   **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information):** This CWE accurately describes the resulting impact where sensitive information is exposed due to the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description strongly supports this assessment.",
