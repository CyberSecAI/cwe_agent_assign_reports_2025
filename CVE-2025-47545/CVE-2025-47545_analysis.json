The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently. |\n| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate.

The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-362, which is a Class-level CWE. While it's generally preferred to select Base or Variant level CWEs, the provided information doesn't give enough specifics to narrow it down further. CWE-362 has child CWEs like CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition) which could be a better fit if more details were available. CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) is also related as it's a general case of synchronization issues, and CWE-362 is a specific type of improper synchronization. These peer and hierarchical relationships were considered, but the lack of detail led to keeping the classification at CWE-362 for now.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe362 -->|PARENTOF| cwe367\n    cwe362 -->|PEEROF| cwe662\n    cwe662 -->|PEEROF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367,cwe662 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper synchronization** of shared resources, leading to a **race condition**. The impact is that an attacker can leverage this **race condition** to potentially manipulate data or control program flow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **Race Condition** due to **improper synchronization** when accessing shared resources.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (**Race Condition**)\". This, coupled with the \"Root cause of vulnerability: **Race Condition**\" from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, strongly supports the selection of CWE-362.\n\nCWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests that Base-level children might be more appropriate. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition) is a Base-level child of CWE-362. If we had more information suggesting a TOCTOU vulnerability, CWE-367 would be a better fit. However, without more details, CWE-362 is the most accurate and specific classification possible.\n\nCWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) was considered as a more general case, but the description explicitly mentions a **Race Condition**, making CWE-362 more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This is more specific and requires evidence that the race condition happens within a thread.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
