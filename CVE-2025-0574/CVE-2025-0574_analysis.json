  "description": "Sante PACS Server URL path **Memory Corruption** Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Sante PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of URLs in the web server module. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25318.",

The secondary CWE is CWE-20, which is a Class level CWE. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-20 can precede CWE-787, as **improper input validation** can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

The vulnerability description key phrases also indicated the rootcause as the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which points to CWE-20.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection.
