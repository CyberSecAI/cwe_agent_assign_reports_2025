It provides details about a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the \"Multiple Location Google Map\" WordPress plugin.\\n\\nHere\\'s an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document doesn\\'t specify the exact root cause within the plugin\\'s code, only that it exists.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.\\n*   Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 - A1)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n*   Unauthenticated - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n*   Remove and replace the software, as it is likely abandoned and won\\'t receive updates.\\n*   Deactivating the software is not sufficient unless a vPatch is deployed.\\n*   Patchstack offers vPatching as a mitigation.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Vulnerable versions:** <= 1.1\\n*   **Fixed in:** N/A (No official fix available)\\n*   **CVSS score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack (April 9, 2025)\\n*   The software is considered likely abandoned, with the last update being over a year ago.\\n\\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifically detailing the vulnerability type (CSRF), its potential impact, and mitigation strategies.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:stored cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'stored cross-site scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Ydesignservices Multiple Location Google Map', 'keyphrase': 'Ydesignservices Multiple Location Google Map', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(287.9749045844554)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
