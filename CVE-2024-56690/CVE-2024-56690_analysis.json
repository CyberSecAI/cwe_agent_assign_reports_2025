  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto pcrypt - Call crypto layer directly when padata_do_parallel() return -EBUSY Since commit 8f4f68e788c3 (crypto pcrypt - Fix hungtask for PADATA_RESET), the pcrypt encryption and decryption operations return -EAGAIN when the CPU goes online or offline. In alg_test(), a WARN is generated when pcrypt_aead_decrypt() or pcrypt_aead_encrypt() returns -EAGAIN, the unnecessary panic will occur when panic_on_warn set 1. Fix this issue by calling crypto layer directly without parallelization in that case.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how the `pcrypt` module handles CPU online/offline events when using parallel processing for encryption and decryption. Specifically, after commit 8f4f68e788c3, the `pcrypt` module would return `-EAGAIN` if `padata_do_parallel()` returned `-EBUSY` due to CPU going online or offline.  This behavior led to issues in contexts like `alg_test()`, which would generate a warning. If `panic_on_warn` was set to 1, this warning would lead to an unnecessary panic.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The `pcrypt` module was designed to return `-EAGAIN` when parallel processing was temporarily unavailable. This is a valid error, however, the upper layer didn't handle `-EAGAIN` correctly in cases where it's not an actual failure and can simply be retried in non-parallel mode.\n*   **Unnecessary Panic:** The WARN generated when `-EAGAIN` was returned by `pcrypt_aead_decrypt()` or `pcrypt_aead_encrypt()` could cause a kernel panic if `panic_on_warn` was enabled.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nThe primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. The unnecessary panic can cause the system to crash. While not directly exploitable for privilege escalation or data exfiltration, it can disrupt the normal operation of the affected system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves triggering the condition where `padata_do_parallel()` returns `-EBUSY` which can happen when CPUs are going online or offline. This could be triggered by:\n* A user space program that triggers crypto operations during CPU online/offline events.\n* The system itself going through a CPU online/offline cycle.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\nAn attacker does not necessarily need special privileges or a specific position to exploit this. Triggering CPU online/offline events or simply making calls to the crypto functions in the right time frame to get the -EAGAIN is all that is required.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The fix implemented in the provided patches involves calling the crypto layer directly (without parallelization) when `padata_do_parallel()` returns `-EBUSY`. This ensures that the encryption/decryption operation can proceed without generating an error.\n*   The fix addresses the unnecessary panic during testing and provides a workaround when parallel operations are not available.\n*   The vulnerability is tied to the pcrypt module and the parallel processing functionality within it.\n\nThis issue highlights the importance of correct error handling within kernel modules and how seemingly innocuous error codes can lead to serious issues when not properly managed by the upper layers.",
