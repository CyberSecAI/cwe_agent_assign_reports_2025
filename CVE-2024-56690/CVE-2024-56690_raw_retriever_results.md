# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-56690
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto pcrypt - Call crypto layer directly when padata_do_parallel() return -EBUSY Since commit 8f4f68e788c3 (crypto pcrypt - Fix hungtask for PADATA_RESET), the pcrypt encryption and decryption operations return -EAGAIN when the CPU goes online or offline. In alg_test(), a WARN is generated when pcrypt_aead_decrypt() or pcrypt_aead_encrypt() returns -EAGAIN, the unnecessary panic will occur when panic_on_warn set 1. Fix this issue by calling crypto layer directly without parallelization in that case.
