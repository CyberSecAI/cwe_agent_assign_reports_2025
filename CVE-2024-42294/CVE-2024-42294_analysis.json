  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-42294.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by a deadlock between the `sd_remove` and `sd_release` functions in the Linux kernel's block device handling. This occurs because `sd_remove` attempts to freeze the block device queue and then acquire the disk's `open_mutex`, while `sd_release` can also attempt to acquire the same mutex after having already entered the queue freeze process. The SCSI driver does not set the `GD_OWNS_QUEUE` flag, thus not setting `QUEUE_FLAG_DYING`, creating a classic ABBA deadlock scenario.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Deadlock:**  A classic ABBA deadlock occurs due to the incorrect ordering of mutex acquisition and queue freezing between `sd_remove` and `sd_release`.\n- **Race Condition:** The timing of `sd_remove` and `sd_release` executing concurrently on the same disk leads to the deadlock.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **System Hang:** The deadlock results in hung tasks, causing the system to become unresponsive, as demonstrated by the provided kernel logs with blocked tasks.\n- **Denial of Service:** The hung tasks effectively create a denial-of-service condition, preventing the system from functioning correctly.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Triggering the `sd_remove` path while also having an active process executing `sd_release` on the same device.\n- Specifically, the scenario involves the removal of a SCSI block device (likely USB storage) while an `fsck` process holds an open file descriptor for that device.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the removal of a SCSI device, typically a USB storage device.\n- The attacker also needs a process like `fsck` to be using the device, thus triggering the `sd_release` path when the device removal occurs.\n-  No special privileges are explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the ability to interact with storage devices is needed.",

The conditions necessary for the deadlock involve a race condition (CWE-362) where timing of the concurrent processes leads to inconsistent lock states, and an improper locking strategy (CWE-667) that allows the circular dependency to form.
