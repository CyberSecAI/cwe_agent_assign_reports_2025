  "query": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Network Analytics Manager and Cisco Secure Network Analytics Virtual Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with valid administrative credentials to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in specific fields of the web-based management interface. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.&nbsp",
