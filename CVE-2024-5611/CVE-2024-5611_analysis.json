  "description": "The Stratum - Elementor Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** via the label_years attribute within the Countdown widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.1 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5611\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'Stratum \u2013 Elementor Widgets' plugin's Countdown widget. Specifically, the `label_years` attribute is vulnerable to stored XSS.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `label_years` attribute in the Countdown widget before rendering it on the page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page that utilizes the vulnerable Countdown widget. This injected script will execute within the browsers of users who visit the page, potentially leading to:\n    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.\n    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware onto their systems.\n    - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the page, causing it to display malicious or misleading information.\n    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other interfaces that trick users into providing sensitive information.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Although not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript opens avenues for privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities or weak security practices.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Plugin Configuration:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript through the `label_years` field of the Countdown widget when configuring it via Elementor page builder.\n- **Web Page Rendering:** When a user loads a page with the configured countdown widget the injected malicious script is executed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least \"Contributor\"-level access to the WordPress site.\n- **Elementor Page Builder Access:** The attacker needs to have access to Elementor page builder to be able to create/edit content.\n- **Knowledge of plugin vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the affected plugin and the vulnerable attribute (`label_years`)\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"Stratum \u2013 Elementor Widgets\" plugin up to and including version 1.4.1.\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.4.2. The patch included sanitization of the `label_years` attribute using `esc_html()` and `wp_kses_post()`.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Stratum Elementor Widgets plugin had a stored XSS vulnerability in its countdown widget that allowed attackers with at least Contributor access to inject malicious JavaScript code via the label_years attribute and execute it within the browsers of users who visit the page, potentially leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, malware distribution, and phishing. The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.2 by sanitizing the input before rendering it on the page.",

The plugin fails to neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in a web page, leading to XSS. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-79 description. There are no parent-child or chain relationships crucial in this case, as the description directly points to a classic XSS scenario due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of the `label_years` attribute.\n2.  **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).\n3.  **Impact:** Attackers inject arbitrary web scripts, leading to potential session hijacking, malware distribution, or defacement.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE summary, which explicitly states **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** as the root cause, leading to a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability. The description aligns perfectly with CWE-79, \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\". The retriever results also list CWE-79 as a potential candidate, reinforcing this classification.\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness described: the plugin does not properly neutralize user-controllable input before using it in a web page.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* While CSRF is a web application vulnerability, it doesn't fit the specific root cause described, which is related to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
