## Analysis of CVE-2025-41654 based on provided content:

This content **relates** to CVE-2025-41654. It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated remote attacker to access information about running processes via the SNMP protocol. The amount of data returned can trigger a reboot via the watchdog timer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can access information about running processes.
*   Sending SNMP read commands can trigger a reboot of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote, unauthenticated access via the SNMP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required.
*   Network access to the device.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Ensure only authorized personnel have access to the gateway.
*   Only use the gateway in an isolated network environment.
*   **Remediation:** Install updated firmware V1.3.13.

**CVSS Score:** 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)
