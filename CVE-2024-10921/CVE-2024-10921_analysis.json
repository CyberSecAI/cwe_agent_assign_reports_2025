This issue affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.30 , MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.19, MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.15 and MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to and including 8.0.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of null bytes within specially crafted BSON requests.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the way MongoDB Server handles malformed BSON data, specifically the presence of null bytes. This improper handling can lead to buffer over-reads.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authorized user can trigger crashes or receive the contents of buffer over-reads of server memory. This could potentially lead to information disclosure.\n*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted requests containing malformed BSON to the MongoDB server.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user and must be able to send requests to the MongoDB server.\n\n**Summary:** The vulnerability is due to the server's failure to properly handle null bytes in BSON requests. This can result in buffer over-reads, causing crashes or leaking server memory. It can be triggered by any authorized user sending malformed BSON.",

CWE-20 is a class-level CWE for improper input validation, and it is related to CWE-125 as a potential cause. The hierarchical relationship is that CWE-125 can be a consequence of CWE-20, as improper input validation can lead to out-of-bounds reads.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **construction of malformed BSON** (potentially linked to improper input validation), leading to a buffer over-read, and ultimately resulting in crashes or information disclosure (reading server memory).\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> Malformed BSON -> CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) -> Information Disclosure/Crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) that occurs due to the server's improper handling of **malformed BSON**. While the vulnerability description mentions \"specially crafted requests that **construct malformed BSON**,\" which could be related to input validation, the core issue is the resulting out-of-bounds read. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a possible contributing factor but is too general. The evidence primarily supports CWE-125 due to the clear mention of \"buffer over-reads of Server memory.\" The retriever results also list CWE-125 with a high score.\n\nCWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) was considered but is too general.
