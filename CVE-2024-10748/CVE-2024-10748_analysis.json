  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Cosmote Greece Whats Up App 4.47.3 on Android. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file gr/desquared/kmmsharedmodule/db/RealmDB.java of the component Realm Database Handler. The manipulation of the argument defaultRealmKey leads to use of default cryptographic key. Local access is required to approach this attack. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

This key is used to encrypt the Realm database file named `defaultKMMV4.realm.enc`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Hardcoded encryption key within the application's source code.\n- Use of the same encryption key across all installations of the application.\n- Insecure storage of the encryption key within the application's APK.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to confidential user information, including sensitive personal data and credit card details by decrypting the database.\n- Violation of data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Reverse engineering and decompiling the application's APK file to extract the hardcoded encryption key.\n- Gaining access to the device or a backup of the application's data to decrypt the database contents.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to obtain and decompile the application's APK file.\n- Ability to access the application's encrypted database file either directly from the device or via a backup.\n- Basic understanding of encryption and decryption techniques.\n\nThe content provides more technical details than the official CVE description, including:\n- The specific location of the hardcoded key within the source code (`RealmDB.java`).\n- The exact hardcoded key value.\n- Code snippets for decrypting the database using the hardcoded key, both in Java and in a Realm Studio.\n- Recommendations for secure encryption key management, including using Android Keystore, generating unique keys per device, and using KDFs.",

CWE-321 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, focusing specifically on cryptographic keys. Since the vulnerability explicitly involves a hard-coded cryptographic key, CWE-321 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -- CHILDOF --> cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The application's source code contains a **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321).\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data by decrypting the database using the hardcoded key.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which explicitly states: \"The application embeds a **hardcoded encryption key** (`defaultRealmKey`) within the source code file `gr/desquared/kmmsharedmodule/db/RealmDB.java`.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-321 having the highest score.\n\nThe choice of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is the use of hardcoded cryptographic keys. While CWE-798 is a broader category, CWE-321 is more precise and therefore more suitable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
