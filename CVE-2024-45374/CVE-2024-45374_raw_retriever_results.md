# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-45374

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-45374
## Query
In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on broadcast keys stored on the device.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'weak password for sharing encryption keys'
