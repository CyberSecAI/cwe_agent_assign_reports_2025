The attacker must also have knowledge of a saved search containing risky commands. The vulnerability requires user interaction.",

The product performs an authorization check but does not correctly perform the check. |\n| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. The root cause may stem from an incorrect privilege assignment, leading to the authorization bypass. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level CWE. It describes a scenario where authorization checks are present but flawed. CWE-266 is a Base-level CWE describing incorrect privilege assignment. The vulnerability could be the result of incorrect privilege assignment, leading to the flawed authorization checks described by CWE-863. There's a potential hierarchical relationship where flawed privilege assignments (CWE-266) could contribute to incorrect authorization (CWE-863).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PeerOf| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe266 -->|PeerOf| cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe266 -->|PeerOf| cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a low-privileged user and the **rootcause** of the **low-privileged user being able to run a saved search with risky commands using the permissions of a higher-privileged user**. This leads to the ability to bypass safeguards, potentially resulting in sensitive information access.\n  - **Root Cause:** Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863) and possibly Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n  - **Weakness:** Bypassing SPL safeguards for risky commands.\n  - **Impact:** Execution of risky commands with elevated privileges, potentially leading to access to sensitive information.\n  - **Attack Vector:** Phishing a higher-privileged user into initiating a request within their browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the retriever results pointed to several authorization and privilege-related CWEs. Given the description, the most fitting primary CWE is CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) because the vulnerability involves the application performing an authorization check, but that check is flawed, allowing a low-privileged user to execute commands with elevated privileges. The retriever results suggested CWE-732, CWE-269, CWE-285, and CWE-863, but after reviewing the details, CWE-863 is more accurate than CWE-285 because the authentication logic is present but flawed.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description clearly states that a **low-privileged user can run a saved search with risky commands using the permissions of a higher-privileged user**. This directly supports the selection of CWE-863, where authorization checks are present but incorrectly implemented. The use of a higher-privileged user's permissions also suggests that an incorrect privilege assignment (CWE-266) may be a contributing factor, making it a secondary candidate.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-863 has peer relationships with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which was considered but deemed less specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**): The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description, where a low-privileged user is able to bypass SPL safeguards due to a flawed authorization mechanism.\n- CWE-266 (**Incorrect Privilege Assignment**): A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. This could be a contributing factor to the authorization bypass, as incorrect privilege assignments might lead to the flawed authorization check.",
