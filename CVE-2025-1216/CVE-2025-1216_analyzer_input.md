## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1216 Content from gitee.com_a4036ac7_20250624_185527.html

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `/oa/notice/list` interface due to unsanitized input in the `sort` parameter. The `sort` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL statement without proper filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP request with a crafted `sort` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `sort` parameter are required to prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Details more than official CVE description:**

The content provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including:

*   Specific file paths where the vulnerability exists (`com/cloudweb/oa/mapper/xml/OaNoticeMapper.xml:58`, `com/cloudweb/oa/mapper/OaNoticeMapper.java:30`, `com/cloudweb/oa/service/impl/OaNoticeServiceImpl.java:117`, `com/cloudweb/oa/controller/OaNoticeController.java:131`).
*   The exact parameter that is vulnerable (`sort`).
*   A Proof of Concept (POC) exploit: `http://localhost:8096/oa/notice/list?sort=) tmp_cunto where 1=1 and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,user(),0x7e),1)-- -`
