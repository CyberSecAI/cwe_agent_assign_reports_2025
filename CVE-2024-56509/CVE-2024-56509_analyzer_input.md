# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56509

## Vulnerability Description
changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. **Improper input validation** in the application can allow attackers to perform local file read (LFR) or **path traversal attacks**. These vulnerabilities occur when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation. For example, using file../../../etc/passwd or file ///etc/passwd can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.05.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper input validation**
- **vector:** file:///etc/passwd
- **weakness:** **path traversal attacks**
- **product:** changedetection.io
- **impact:** bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files, local file read (LFR)
- **attacker:** attackers
- **version:** prior to 0.48.05

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-56509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when handling file paths. The application attempts to prevent access to local files using a regular expression check `if re.search(r'^file:/', url.strip(), re.IGNORECASE):` but this check can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Attackers can manipulate the file path input to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing attackers to use characters like `..` and spaces within the file URI to bypass the checks.
*   **Insufficient Regex:** The initial regular expression used to prevent file access is too simplistic and does not account for variations in file path formats.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Read (LFR):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the server where the application is running. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, user data, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the URL provided to the application. Attackers can craft URLs with `file:` protocol and path traversal sequences.
*   **Direct Input:** Attackers provide the malicious file path directly, for example, when setting up a new watch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's interface to input the manipulated URLs.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any specific privileges or user interaction, making it easier to exploit for any user with access to the application.
*   **Knowledge of Target File System:** A successful attack requires some knowledge of the server's file system structure to craft valid path traversal sequences.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `changedetection.io` application.
*   The problematic code is in `changedetectionio/processors/__init__.py`, specifically where the URL is checked for the `file:/` protocol.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated through proof-of-concept (PoC) that involves setting up a new watch with a malicious file path like `file:../../../../etc/passwd`.
*   The fix involves a stricter file protocol checking which is implemented in the commit `f7e9846` (https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/f7e9846c9b40a229813d19cdb66bf60fbe5e6a2a) which implements the fix for CVE-2024-56509. The commit message indicates that a "Stricter file protocol checking pre-check" was added.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in versions 0.48.05 and later.
*   The original flawed regex is `r'^file:/'` which is updated to check for variations such as `file:../../../../etc/passwd` and `file: ///etc/passwd`.
