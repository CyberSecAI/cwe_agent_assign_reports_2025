With this, attackers can also create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** reveal database contents, create and read arbitrary files
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **Product:** Palo Alto Networks Expedition

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], which directly reflects the **SQL injection** vulnerability described. **CWE-200** [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a potential secondary impact, but it's a high-level classification and less descriptive of the root cause. **CWE-73** [External Control of File Name or Path] may also be a secondary impact given the arbitrary file creation capability but it is not the direct result of the **SQL Injection**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input leading to **SQL injection**, which then allows for the **exposure of sensitive information** and **external control of file name or path**.

1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] - **SQL injection** due to lack of input sanitization.
2.  **Impact 1:** **CWE-200** [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] - Exposure of database contents like password hashes.
3.  **Impact 2:** **CWE-73** [External Control of File Name or Path] - Creation and reading of arbitrary files.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], as indicated by the vulnerability description and CVE reference which specifically mentions an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input. The reference link states, "The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input... are directly used within a SQL query without any sanitization." This aligns perfectly with the definition of **CWE-89**. The other suggested CWEs either describe impacts or are less specific. **CWE-200** [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] could be considered an impact of the **SQL injection**, but is a high level class, and is discouraged. **CWE-73** [External Control of File Name or Path] is another potential impact, but secondary to the injection itself. The choice of **CWE-89** is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly addresses the root cause.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes sensitive information to a log file.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the
