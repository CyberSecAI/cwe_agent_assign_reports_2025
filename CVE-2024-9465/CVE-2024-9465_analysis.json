  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9465:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php` file. Specifically, the `routeName` and `id` parameters, when the `action` parameter is set to `import`, are directly used within a SQL query without any sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries using user-controlled input without sanitization and it is accessible without authentication.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and device API keys.\n- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php`.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable Expedition server.\n- **No Privileges:** No user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is present in the `CHECKPOINT.php` file, where SQL queries are constructed with unsanitized user input.\n- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `routeName` parameter.\n- The blog post details how to first create the necessary table using the `action=get` parameter and then trigger the SQL injection using `action=import`.\n- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform blind SQL injection using time-based payloads to extract data using tools like SQLMap.\n- The Palo Alto advisory confirms that CVE-2024-9465 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.\n- There is evidence of active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the basic CVE description.",
