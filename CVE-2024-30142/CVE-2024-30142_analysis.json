CWE-79 was considered due to the mention of **XSS** as a potential vector, but it's a secondary concern. The selection of CWE-614 as a Variant provides a specific description of the cookie issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe614\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing secure flag** on the cookie (CWE-614). This can lead to session cookies being transmitted over an unencrypted channel (CWE-319) or being exploited via **XSS** (CWE-79), ultimately resulting in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description key phrases stating the **rootcause** as \"missing secure flag on cookie.\" This aligns directly with CWE-614. While **XSS** is mentioned, it is more of a potential attack vector that could exploit the **missing secure flag**. Therefore, CWE-614 is the primary and most specific CWE to address the **rootcause**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-614 being a Variant that accurately represents the vulnerability, and CWE-79 being a Base that represents the secondary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE perfectly describes the vulnerability and is the primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is similar but addresses a different attribute, so it is not as accurate.\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is about cookie validation, which is not the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is too general and doesn't directly address the cookie issue.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE describes an **XSS** vulnerability, which is related but more of an attack vector.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
