  "description": "Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners. Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.",

This is because the runner user is part of the docker group, allowing interaction with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- The 'disable-sudo' policy can be bypassed.\n- Privilege escalation via Docker.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nAn attacker with the ability to run malicious code on a runner configured with `disable-sudo: true` can escalate privileges to root using Docker, defeating the intended security control.\n\nAttack vectors:\nAn attacker needs the ability to run their malicious code on the runner. This could be achieved through:\n- Supply chain attacks (e.g., similar to tj-actions).\n- Exploiting a Pwn Request vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAbility to run malicious code on the runner.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in Harden-Runner version `v2.12.0`.  Users should migrate to the stronger `disable-sudo-and-containers` policy. This setting:\n- Disables sudo access.\n- Removes access to dockerd and containerd sockets.\n- Uninstalls Docker from the runner entirely, preventing container-based privilege escalation paths.\n```",

The runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem, leading to a bypass of the disable-sudo policy. |\n| CWE-277 | Insecure Inherited Permissions | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The docker group inherits permissions that allow bypassing intended restrictions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n- The primary CWE is CWE-267, which has a parent-child relationship with CWE-277.\n- CWE-267 represents the core issue of a privilege enabling unsafe actions, while CWE-277 highlights the insecure inheritance of these permissions.\n- The selection prioritizes the root cause, with the inherited permissions contributing to the bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe277 -->|CHILDOF| cwe267\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe267 primary\n    class cwe277 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `disable-sudo` policy intended to restrict the runner user. However, the runner user's membership in the docker group grants privileges to interact with the Docker daemon. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the intended restriction.\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-267 Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n- **Weakness:** The runner user being part of the docker group.\n- **Impact:** Ability to regain root access or restore the sudoers file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The **weakness** lies in the fact that the runner user, despite the `disable-sudo` policy, retains membership in the docker group. This allows the bypass of the intended security control.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-267, aptly describes the core issue: a privilege (membership in the docker group) enables unsafe actions (launching privileged containers or accessing the host filesystem).\n\nCWE-277, Insecure Inherited Permissions, is a secondary candidate since the docker group inherently has permissions that allow for this bypass.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). However, these are less directly related to the root cause. The core issue isn't primarily an authorization or authentication failure, but the existence of a privilege that enables unsafe actions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-267 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
