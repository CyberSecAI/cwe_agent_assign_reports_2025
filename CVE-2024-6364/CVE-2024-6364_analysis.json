This may allow a skilled attacker with both physical access to the device, and full hostile network control, to initiate OS commands on the device. To remediate this vulnerability, update the device firmware to the latest available version. Please contact the device manufacturer for upgrade instructions or contact Absolute Security, see reference below.",

  "reference_content": "## CVE-2024-6364 Analysis\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2024-6364, providing details beyond the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability applies to Windows devices with older firmware versions where no Absolute Persistence Software has been activated.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nThe advisory details a vulnerability present in older firmware versions of devices without Absolute Persistence Software. The specific weakness isn't detailed beyond this.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nExploitation requires both physical access to the device and hostile network control. There are no known exploits at the time of the advisory.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Physical access to the device\n*   Hostile network control\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs both physical access to the device *and* control of the network the device is connected to.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is not present on devices with Absolute Persistence Module version 2.8 or higher.\n*   Updating to the latest firmware versions is recommended.\n*   Specific remediation steps are provided for personal users and businesses/enterprises via links:\n    *   [https://www.absolute.com/platform/security-information/vulnerability-archive/security-notice-important-update-for-your-device](https://www.absolute.com/platform/security-information/vulnerability-archive/security-notice-important-update-for-your-device)\n    *   [https://www.absolute.com/platform/security-information/vulnerability-archive/firmware-security-advisory-for-business-and-enterprise](https://www.absolute.com/platform/security-information/vulnerability-archive/firmware-security-advisory-for-business-and-enterprise)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The advisory was published on May 13, 2025.\n*   The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity.\n*   Absolute Security works with device manufacturers to support BIOS updates.",

While other CWEs like authentication bypass could be tangentially related, the direct impact and described mechanism point strongly to command injection. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it directly describes the flaw: **improper neutralization** leading to command execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|ChildOf| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|ParentOf| cwe78\n    cwe77 -->|ParentOf| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a device in a **not activated** state (Absolute Persistence). An attacker with physical access and network control can then inject OS commands due to the **improper neutralization** of special elements. This leads to the ability to initiate OS commands on the device.\n  - **Root Cause:** Device is not activated and has older firmware versions.\n  - **Weakness:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in OS commands\n  - **Impact:** OS Command Injection leading to arbitrary command execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that a skilled attacker can \"initiate OS commands on the device.\" This, coupled with the requirement of physical access and hostile network control when the Absolute Persistence software is **not activated**, points to the potential for command injection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is based on the fact that this is the most direct and specific CWE that describes the vulnerability. The attacker is able to \"initiate OS commands,\" suggesting that the system is not properly neutralizing special elements in those commands.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, but ultimately deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')] and CWE-73 [External Control of File Name or Path] were considered, but discarded because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention file path manipulation.\n*   CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] and CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] were considered, but the primary issue is not a failure in authentication or authorization, but rather the ability to inject commands.\n*   CWE-912 [Hidden Functionality] was considered, but is not directly related to the **weakness** of command injection.\n*   CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] was considered, but the vulnerability description doesn't mention anything related to signatures.\n\nUltimately, CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] at the Base level of abstraction provides the most accurate and specific description of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.",
