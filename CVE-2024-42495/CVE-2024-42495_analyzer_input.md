# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42495

## Vulnerability Description
Credentials to access device configuration were transmitted using an unencrypted protocol. These credentials would allow read-only access to network configuration information and terminal configuration data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **transmission of credentials using unencrypted protocol**
- **impact:** read-only access to network and terminal configuration

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-42495:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Missing encryption of sensitive data: Credentials used to access device configuration were transmitted using an unencrypted protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted transmission of credentials. Specifically, credentials to access device configuration were transmitted using an unencrypted protocol. This is identified as CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain read-only access to network configuration information and terminal configuration data by intercepting the unencrypted credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network access (AV:A in CVSS v3.1, AV:A in CVSS v4). This indicates the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device to intercept the unencrypted credentials. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Hughes Network Systems WL3000 Fusion Software versions prior to 2.7.0.10.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.5 with a vector string of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- The CVSS v4.0 base score is 7.1 with a vector string of CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher.
- A patch is available and does not require user action.
