  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-42495:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- Missing encryption of sensitive data: Credentials used to access device configuration were transmitted using an unencrypted protocol.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unencrypted transmission of credentials. Specifically, credentials to access device configuration were transmitted using an unencrypted protocol. This is identified as CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker could gain read-only access to network configuration information and terminal configuration data by intercepting the unencrypted credentials.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is adjacent network access (AV:A in CVSS v3.1, AV:A in CVSS v4). This indicates the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device to intercept the unencrypted credentials. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects Hughes Network Systems WL3000 Fusion Software versions prior to 2.7.0.10.\n- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.5 with a vector string of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n- The CVSS v4.0 base score is 7.1 with a vector string of CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.\n- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher.\n- A patch is available and does not require user action.",

The credentials were sent without encryption, which is the direct cause of the vulnerability. |\n| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data | 0.8 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. High-level; the root cause of not encrypting the credentials during transmission. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) directly describes the **transmission of credentials using an unencrypted protocol**, while CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a more general case. Since the vulnerability specifically involves the transmission of data, CWE-319 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **transmission of credentials using unencrypted protocol** (CWE-319), which leads to the impact of allowing read-only access to network and terminal configuration (Information Exposure).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The vulnerability is due to the **transmission of credentials using unencrypted protocol**, which directly maps to CWE-319.\n\nCWE-319 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability because it focuses on the transmission aspect. While CWE-311 is also relevant, it is a higher-level classification. The retriever results also support this, listing CWE-319 as the top result.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is about the transmission, not the storage, of credentials.\n*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): While related, this is a higher-level class that encompasses various credential protection issues. CWE-319 is more specific to the unencrypted transmission.\n*   CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials): Similar to CWE-319, but slightly broader. CWE-319 is more direct in specifying cleartext transmission.\n* CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): This CWE is not relevant since the vulnerability is about the transmission of credentials, and not about the credentials being hard-coded.\n* CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel): This CWE is not relevant since the vulnerability is about the transmission of credentials and not related to authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
