# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10396

## Vulnerability Description
An authenticated user can **provide a malformed ACL** to the fileservers StoreACL RPC, causing the fileserver to crash, possibly expose **uninitialized memory**, and possibly store garbage data in the audit log. Malformed ACLs provided in responses to client FetchACL RPCs can cause client processes to crash and possibly expose **uninitialized memory** into other ACLs stored on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized memory**
- **weakness:** **provide a malformed ACL**
- **impact:** crash and possibly expose uninitialized memory
- **vector:** malformed ACLs
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **component:** StoreACL RPC and FetchACL RPCs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the way the OpenAFS fileserver parses ACL strings provided by clients via the `RXAFS_StoreACL` and `RXAFS_OldStoreACL` RPCs. This parsing logic uses a combination of `sscanf()` and manual string examination, which is vulnerable to malformed ACL strings. The server expects newline characters to delimit ACL entries, but fails to properly handle missing null terminators, leading to out-of-bounds reads and potentially memory corruption.  Similar parsing issues exist within the client when processing ACLs received by the `RXAFS_FetchACL` RPC

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The fileserver can read beyond the allocated buffer for the ACL string if it's missing a null terminator. This can happen when searching for newlines.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** Out-of-bounds reads can expose uninitialized memory.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The fileserver can attempt to dereference the address 0x1 if a null terminator is present after a malformed ACL line.
*   **Memory Leak:** If parsing errors occur after the first two lines of the ACL, the memory allocated for the parsed ACL is not freed.
*  **Logging of Garbage Data:** If the fileserver audit log is enabled and the ACL string does not contain a null terminator, it can log garbage to the audit log, potentially crashing the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Fileserver Crash (Denial of Service):** Malformed ACLs can lead to crashes due to segmentation faults or other errors, causing a denial of service.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** Memory leaks can lead to the fileserver using up all available memory.
*   **Information Leak (Potentially):** Uninitialized memory could be written into the stored ACL, which could then be read back, potentially revealing sensitive data like other file contents or encryption keys.
*   **Client Crash:** Malformed ACLs in `RXAFS_FetchACL` responses can cause client processes to crash and potentially expose uninitialized memory.
*   **Garbage Data in Audit Logs:** Malformed ACLs can cause garbage data to be logged to the audit logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`RXAFS_StoreACL` RPC:** An authenticated user with the ability to change ACLs can send a malformed ACL string to the fileserver, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **`RXAFS_FetchACL` RPC:** A malicious server can send a malformed ACL string to a client, triggering a crash on the client side.
*   **Audit Log:** A malformed ACL string can also crash the fileserver when it tries to write the string to the audit log. This is possible without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For `RXAFS_StoreACL` Exploitation (Fileserver):**
    *   An attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to change ACLs. This typically requires 'a' (administer) rights, membership in the `system:administrators` group, or ownership of the volume.
    *   They need the ability to send custom RPC requests, as standard OpenAFS tools cannot generate the required malformed ACLs.
*   **For `RXAFS_FetchACL` Exploitation (Client):**
     * A compromised or malicious server is required to send malformed ACLs back to clients.
*   **For Audit Log Exploitation:**
    * No authentication or special permissions are required as long as the audit log is enabled on the fileserver, and they must also have the capability to send custom RPC requests.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description, explaining the vulnerability's technical aspects and specific attack vectors.
*   The advisory outlines mitigation strategies, including upgrading to patched versions of OpenAFS or disabling ACL changes/audit logging, in addition to the suggested patches.
*   It also mentions that client-side crashes due to `FetchACL` are generally limited to ephemeral user space processes.
* The CVSS scores are provided with slightly different impact based on various attack vectors.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause denial of service, memory leaks, and potentially leak sensitive data by sending malformed ACL strings to the OpenAFS fileserver. The same weakness in client-side ACL parsing may lead to denial of service and memory leaks on clients.
