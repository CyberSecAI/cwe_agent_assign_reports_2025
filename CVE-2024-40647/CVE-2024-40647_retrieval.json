  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-40647', description='sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentrys Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Pythons `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if its not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.', key_phrases={'rootcause': \"bug in Sentry's Python SDK\", 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'pass environment variables to subprocesses', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'sentry-sdk', 'version': '< 2.8.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-40647:\\n\\n**1. Verification:**\\n\\nThe provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-40647. It describes a vulnerability in the Sentry Python SDK that unintentionally exposes environment variables to subprocesses and links to the GitHub Security Advisory that includes the CVE ID.\\n\\n**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe root cause lies in how the Sentry Python SDK\\'s `StdlibIntegration` handles the `env` argument when calling `subprocess.Popen`. When an empty dictionary `{}` was explicitly passed as the `env` argument to `subprocess.Popen`, the SDK incorrectly interpreted it as a `None` environment. Consequently, instead of passing an empty environment, the SDK passed the entire environment of the parent process to the subprocess.\\n\\n**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n- **Unintentional Environment Variable Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintended leakage of environment variables to child processes. This happens even when the user explicitly sets `env={}` in the `subprocess` call, intending to pass no environment variables.\\n\\n**4. Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information stored in environment variables. If an attacker can influence the execution of a subprocess through the vulnerable Sentry SDK, they could gain access to sensitive data present in the environment of the parent process. This could include API keys, passwords, or other confidential information.\\n\\n**5. Attack vectors:**\\n\\n- **Subprocess Execution:** The attack vector involves a scenario where the application using the vulnerable Sentry SDK executes subprocesses using the Python `subprocess` module while also using the `StdlibIntegration` of the Sentry SDK. If the application is passing a specific `env` argument, the vulnerability would not be triggered.\\n\\n**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n- **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to have some control over the code being executed by the Python application to be able to trigger the spawning of a subprocess using the `subprocess` module with an empty `env` argument while the Sentry SDK\\'s `StdlibIntegration` is enabled.\\n- **Environment Access:** The attacker benefits most when the parent process\\' environment contains sensitive information that can be accessed by the spawned child process.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n- **Affected Versions:** Sentry Python SDK versions prior to 2.8.0 are affected.\\n- **Patched Versions:** The issue has been patched in versions 2.8.0 and 1.45.1.\\n- **Workarounds:**\\n    - Replace `env={}` with `env={\"EMPTY_ENV\": \"1\"}` or similar in application code.\\n    - Disable the `StdlibIntegration` in the Sentry SDK initialization.\\n\\nThis analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, offering a comprehensive view of the vulnerability.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '201', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(803.5993058616739)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '923', 'name': 'Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(789.8105538949362)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '668', 'name': 'Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(785.3910644133124)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '525', 'name': 'Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(774.7719006904971)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '290', 'name': 'Authentication Bypass by Spoofing', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(771.8669971461659)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '526', 'name': 'Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable', 'type': 'Variant', 'original_content': 'The product uses an environment variable to store unencrypted sensitive information.', 'keyphrase_source': \"rootcause:bug in Sentry's Python SDK\", 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Users who are unable to update are advised to disable the Discourse-reactions plugin in admin panel.\n\n- CVE-2021-37326: NetSarang Xshell 7 before Build 0077 includes unintended code strings in paste operations.\n\n- CVE-2020-13597: Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta5, a user's read state for a topic such as the last read post number and the notification level is exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-38999: IBM MQ Appliance could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information by inclusion of sensitive data within trace.\n\n- CVE-2021-20498: IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 reveals version information in HTTP requests that could be used in further attacks against the system.

IBM X-Force ID: 199398.\n\n- CVE-2021-28544: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 212038\n\n- CVE-2021-39013: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.7.2.0, 1.7.1.0, and 1.7.0.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in HTTP responses that could be used in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 213651.\n\n- CVE-2021-41767: Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses. This may allow an authenticated user who already has permission to access a particular connection to read from or interact with another user's active use of that same connection.\n\n- CVE-2021-45603: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by disclosure of sensitive information. A UPnP request reveals a device's serial number, which can be used for a password reset. This affects D7800 before 1.0.1.66, EX2700 before 1.0.1.68, WN3000RPv2 before 1.0.0.90, WN3000RPv3 before 1.0.2.100, LBR1020 before 2.6.5.20, LBR20 before 2.6.5.32, R6700AX before 1.0.10.110, R7800 before 1.0.2.86, R8900 before 1.0.5.38, R9000 before 1.0.5.38, RAX10 before 1.0.10.110, RAX120v1 before 1.2.3.28, RAX120v2 before 1.2.3.28, RAX70 before 1.0.10.110, RAX78 before 1.0.10.110, XR450 before 2.3.2.130, XR500 before 2.3.2.130, and XR700 before 1.0.1.46.\n\n- CVE-2022-27671: A CSRF token visible in the URL may possibly lead to information disclosure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-31955: Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-36101: Shopware is an open source e-commerce software. In affected versions the request for the customer detail view in the backend administration contained sensitive data like the hashed password and the session ID. These fields are now explicitly unset in version 5.7.15. Users are advised to update and may get the update either via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0654: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository fgribreau/node-request-retry prior to 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-0577: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository scrapy/scrapy prior to 2.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-30334: Brave before 1.34, when a Private Window with Tor Connectivity is used, leaks .onion URLs in Referer and Origin headers. NOTE: although this was fixed by Brave, the Brave documentation still advises \"Note that Private Windows with Tor Connectivity in Brave are just regular private windows that use Tor as a proxy. Brave does NOT implement most of the privacy protections from Tor Browser.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-39193: An issue was discovered in the CheckUser extension for MediaWiki through 1.39.x. Various components of this extension can expose information on the performer of edits and logged actions. This information should not allow public viewing: it is supposed to be viewable only by users with suppression rights.\n\n- CVE-2022-31308: A vulnerability in live_mfg.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.191012 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-31309: A vulnerability in live_check.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.180719 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-35147: DoraCMS v2.18 and earlier allows attackers to bypass login authentication via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-20260: A flaw was found in the Foreman project. The Datacenter plugin exposes the password through the API to an authenticated local attacker with view_hosts permission. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23538: github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually. This issue affects: OTRS AG OTRSCustomContactFields 8.0.x version: 8.0.11 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-1595: The HC Custom WP-Admin URL WordPress plugin through 1.4 leaks the secret login URL when sending a specific crafted request\n\n- CVE-2022-21642: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions when composing a message from topic the composer user suggestions reveals whisper participants. The issue has been patched in stable version 2.7.13 and beta version 2.8.0.beta11. There is no workaround for this issue and users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-21712: twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python. In affected versions twisted exposes cookies and authorization headers when following cross-origin redirects. This issue is present in the `twited.web.RedirectAgent` and `twisted.web. BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24737: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27630: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_master_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi MS1G_00_01.00_14. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can send packets to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-27633: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_guest_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi MS1G_00_01.00_14.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2021-40496: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role). Users in the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve managed-network data that was not set to be accessible to the entire group (i.e., was only set to be accessible to a subset of that group).\n\n- CVE-2021-44524: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal message broker system. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to subscribe to arbitrary message queues.\n\n- CVE-2021-44523: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal activity feed database. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read, modify or delete activity feed entries.\n\n- CVE-2022-28160: Jenkins Tests Selector Plugin 1.3.3 and earlier allows users with Item/Configure permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-39015: Under certain conditions, BOE AdminTools/ BOE SDK allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted.\n\n- CVE-2022-32249: Under special integration scenario of SAP Business one and SAP HANA - version 10.0, an attacker can exploit HANA cockpit?s data volume to gain access to highly sensitive information (e.g., high privileged account credentials)\n\n- CVE-2022-26121: An exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668] in FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager GUI 7.0.0 through 7.0.3, 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, 6.2.0 through 6.2.9, 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, 5.6.0 through 5.6.11 may allow an unauthenticated and remote attacker to access report template images via referencing the name in the URL path.\n\n- CVE-2022-28924: An information disclosure vulnerability in UniverSIS-Students before v1.5.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted GET request to the endpoint /api/students/me/courses/.\n\n- CVE-2022-3866: HashiCorp Nomad and Nomad Enterprise 1.4.0 up to 1.4.1 workload identity token can list non-sensitive metadata for paths under nomad/ that belong to other jobs in the same namespace. Fixed in 1.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45438: When explicitly enabling the feature flag DASHBOARD_CACHE (disabled by default), the system allowed for an unauthenticated user to access dashboard configuration metadata using a REST API Get endpoint. This issue affects Apache Superset version 1.5.2 and prior versions and version 2.0.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-46756:  Dell VxRail, versions prior to 7.0.410, contain a Container Escape Vulnerability. A local high-privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the container's underlying OS. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker. \n\n- CVE-2022-22515: A remote, authenticated attacker could utilize the control program of the CODESYS Control runtime system to use the vulnerability in order to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected products.\n\n- CVE-2022-22732: A CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that could cause all remote domains to access the resources (data) supplied by the server when an attacker sends a fetch request from third-party site or malicious site.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature.

Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

          "matched_text": "CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nResources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-3733: Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n\n- CVE-2005-0406: Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG.

This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-3681: A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in \"galaxy.yml\" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.\n\n- CVE-2021-3602: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).\n\n- CVE-2022-24719: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24798: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2818: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository cockpit-hq/cockpit prior to 2.2.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-25187: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.79 and earlier does not redact some sensitive information in the support bundle.\n\n- CVE-2022-0355: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM simple-get prior to 4.0.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-0536: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM follow-redirects prior to 1.14.8. \n\n- CVE-2022-1650: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository eventsource/eventsource prior to v2.0.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-1893: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository polonel/trudesk prior to 1.2.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-31042: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n- CVE-2022-31043: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are not expected or required.\n\n- CVE-2022-31090: Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n- CVE-2022-31112: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields.\n\n- CVE-2022-33740: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2022-3460: In affected versions of Octopus Deploy it is possible for certain types of sensitive variables to inadvertently become unmasked when viewed in variable preview.\n\n- CVE-2022-4734: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.1. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-201 (CanPrecede)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration.

(The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.

The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

An unauthorized remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to acquire the Session IDs of other general users only.\n\n- CVE-2022-34180: Jenkins Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check in the HTTP endpoint it provides for \"unprotected\" status badge access, allowing attackers without any permissions to obtain the build status badge icon for any attacker-specified job and/or build.\n\n- CVE-2022-31087: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2354: The WP-DBManager WordPress plugin before 2.80.8 does not prevent administrators from running arbitrary commands on the server in multisite installations, where only super-administrators should.\n\n- CVE-2022-32310: An access control issue in Ingredient Stock Management System v1.0 allows attackers to take over user accounts via a crafted POST request to /isms/classes/Users.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-21678: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `tests-passed` branch, version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `beta` branch, and version 2.7.13 in the `stable` branch, the bios of users who made their profiles private were still visible in the `<meta>` tags on their users' pages. The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.\n\n- CVE-2022-2462: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace. In affected versions metadata on a withdrawn Item is exposed via the XMLUI \"mets.xml\" object, as long as you know the handle/URL of the withdrawn Item. This vulnerability only impacts the XMLUI. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4 or newer.\n\n- CVE-2022-41944: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products). An endpoint in the backend Tomcat server of the Pascom allows SSRF, a related issue to CVE-2019-18394.\n\n- CVE-2021-21973: The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue by sending a POST request to vCenter Server plugin leading to information disclosure. This affects: VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before 6.7 U3l and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and 3.x before 3.10.1.2).\n\n- CVE-2021-21975: Server Side Request Forgery in vRealize Operations Manager API (CVE-2021-21975) prior to 8.4 may allow a malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack to steal administrative credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-27103: Accellion FTA 9_12_411 and earlier is affected by SSRF via a crafted POST request to wmProgressstat.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_416 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-40438: A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-22986: On BIG-IP versions 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.2.1, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, and 12.1.x before 12.1.5.3 amd BIG-IQ 7.1.0.x before 7.1.0.3 and 7.0.0.x before 7.0.0.2, the iControl REST interface has an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-26855: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-34473: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40604: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in IPS Community Suite before 4.6.2 allows remote authenticated users to request arbitrary URLs or trigger deserialization via phar protocol when generating class names dynamically. In some cases an exploitation is possible by an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1592: Server-Side Request Forgery in scout in GitHub repository clinical-genomics/scout prior to v4.42. An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attack to discover internal network topology base on query response.\n\n- CVE-2022-36997: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup 8.1.x through 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.x through 8.3.0.2, 9.x through 9.0.0.1, and 9.1.x through 9.1.0.1 (and related NetBackup products). An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",

The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.\n\n- CVE-2021-33687: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\n- CVE-2021-3509: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4. Accessing the endpoint /api/version leaks internal information for the system, and this endpoint is not protected with authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-30156: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Special:Contributions can leak that a \"hidden\" user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-32731: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40862: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise up to v202108-1 contained an API endpoint that erroneously disclosed a sensitive URL to authenticated parties, which could be used for privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of a Terraform configuration. Fixed in v202109-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-41140: Discourse-reactions is a plugin for the Discourse platform that allows user to add their reactions to the post. In affected versions reactions given by user to secure topics and private messages are visible. This issue is patched in version 0.2 of discourse-reaction. Users who are unable to update are advised to disable the Discourse-reactions plugin in admin panel.\n\n- CVE-2021-37326: NetSarang Xshell 7 before Build 0077 includes unintended code strings in paste operations.\n\n- CVE-2020-13597: Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta5, a user's read state for a topic such as the last read post number and the notification level is exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-38999: IBM MQ Appliance could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information by inclusion of sensitive data within trace.\n\n- CVE-2021-20498: IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 reveals version information in HTTP requests that could be used in further attacks against the system.

When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0654: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository fgribreau/node-request-retry prior to 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-0577: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository scrapy/scrapy prior to 2.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-30334: Brave before 1.34, when a Private Window with Tor Connectivity is used, leaks .onion URLs in Referer and Origin headers. NOTE: although this was fixed by Brave, the Brave documentation still advises \"Note that Private Windows with Tor Connectivity in Brave are just regular private windows that use Tor as a proxy. Brave does NOT implement most of the privacy protections from Tor Browser.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-39193: An issue was discovered in the CheckUser extension for MediaWiki through 1.39.x. Various components of this extension can expose information on the performer of edits and logged actions. This information should not allow public viewing: it is supposed to be viewable only by users with suppression rights.\n\n- CVE-2022-31308: A vulnerability in live_mfg.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.191012 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-31309: A vulnerability in live_check.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.180719 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-35147: DoraCMS v2.18 and earlier allows attackers to bypass login authentication via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-20260: A flaw was found in the Foreman project. The Datacenter plugin exposes the password through the API to an authenticated local attacker with view_hosts permission. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23538: github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24737: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27630: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_master_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi MS1G_00_01.00_14. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to information disclosure.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2021-40496: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role). Users in the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve managed-network data that was not set to be accessible to the entire group (i.e., was only set to be accessible to a subset of that group).\n\n- CVE-2021-44524: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal message broker system. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to subscribe to arbitrary message queues.\n\n- CVE-2021-44523: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal activity feed database. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read, modify or delete activity feed entries.\n\n- CVE-2022-28160: Jenkins Tests Selector Plugin 1.3.3 and earlier allows users with Item/Configure permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-39015: Under certain conditions, BOE AdminTools/ BOE SDK allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted.\n\n- CVE-2022-32249: Under special integration scenario of SAP Business one and SAP HANA - version 10.0, an attacker can exploit HANA cockpit?s data volume to gain access to highly sensitive information (e.g., high privileged account credentials)\n\n- CVE-2022-26121: An exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668] in FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager GUI 7.0.0 through 7.0.3, 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, 6.2.0 through 6.2.9, 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, 5.6.0 through 5.6.11 may allow an unauthenticated and remote attacker to access report template images via referencing the name in the URL path.\n\n- CVE-2022-28924: An information disclosure vulnerability in UniverSIS-Students before v1.5.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted GET request to the endpoint /api/students/me/courses/.\n\n- CVE-2022-3866: HashiCorp Nomad and Nomad Enterprise 1.4.0 up to 1.4.1 workload identity token can list non-sensitive metadata for paths under nomad/ that belong to other jobs in the same namespace. Fixed in 1.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45438: When explicitly enabling the feature flag DASHBOARD_CACHE (disabled by default), the system allowed for an unauthenticated user to access dashboard configuration metadata using a REST API Get endpoint. This issue affects Apache Superset version 1.5.2 and prior versions and version 2.0.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-46756:  Dell VxRail, versions prior to 7.0.410, contain a Container Escape Vulnerability. A local high-privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the container's underlying OS. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker. \n\n- CVE-2022-22515: A remote, authenticated attacker could utilize the control program of the CODESYS Control runtime system to use the vulnerability in order to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected products.\n\n- CVE-2022-22732: A CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that could cause all remote domains to access the resources (data) supplied by the server when an attacker sends a fetch request from third-party site or malicious site. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Power Commission (Versions prior to V2.22)\n\n- CVE-2022-32530: A CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that could cause users to be misled, hiding alarms, showing the wrong server connection option or the wrong control request when a mobile device has been compromised by a malicious application.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer.

Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-3733: Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n\n- CVE-2005-0406: Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG.

This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-3681: A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in \"galaxy.yml\" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.\n\n- CVE-2021-3602: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).\n\n- CVE-2022-24719: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24798: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2818: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository cockpit-hq/cockpit prior to 2.2.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-25187: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.79 and earlier does not redact some sensitive information in the support bundle.\n\n- CVE-2022-0355: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM simple-get prior to 4.0.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-0536: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM follow-redirects prior to 1.14.8. \n\n- CVE-2022-1650: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository eventsource/eventsource prior to v2.0.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-1893: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository polonel/trudesk prior to 1.2.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-31042: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n- CVE-2022-31043: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are not expected or required.\n\n- CVE-2022-31090: Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n- CVE-2022-31112: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields.\n\n- CVE-2022-33740: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2022-3460: In affected versions of Octopus Deploy it is possible for certain types of sensitive variables to inadvertently become unmasked when viewed in variable preview.\n\n- CVE-2022-4734: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.1. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-201 (CanPrecede)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration.

(The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.

The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

An unauthorized remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to acquire the Session IDs of other general users only.\n\n- CVE-2022-34180: Jenkins Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check in the HTTP endpoint it provides for \"unprotected\" status badge access, allowing attackers without any permissions to obtain the build status badge icon for any attacker-specified job and/or build.\n\n- CVE-2022-31087: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2354: The WP-DBManager WordPress plugin before 2.80.8 does not prevent administrators from running arbitrary commands on the server in multisite installations, where only super-administrators should.\n\n- CVE-2022-32310: An access control issue in Ingredient Stock Management System v1.0 allows attackers to take over user accounts via a crafted POST request to /isms/classes/Users.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-21678: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `tests-passed` branch, version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `beta` branch, and version 2.7.13 in the `stable` branch, the bios of users who made their profiles private were still visible in the `<meta>` tags on their users' pages. The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.\n\n- CVE-2022-2462: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace. In affected versions metadata on a withdrawn Item is exposed via the XMLUI \"mets.xml\" object, as long as you know the handle/URL of the withdrawn Item. This vulnerability only impacts the XMLUI. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4 or newer.\n\n- CVE-2022-41944: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products). An endpoint in the backend Tomcat server of the Pascom allows SSRF, a related issue to CVE-2019-18394.\n\n- CVE-2021-21973: The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue by sending a POST request to vCenter Server plugin leading to information disclosure. This affects: VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before 6.7 U3l and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and 3.x before 3.10.1.2).\n\n- CVE-2021-21975: Server Side Request Forgery in vRealize Operations Manager API (CVE-2021-21975) prior to 8.4 may allow a malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack to steal administrative credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-27103: Accellion FTA 9_12_411 and earlier is affected by SSRF via a crafted POST request to wmProgressstat.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_416 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-40438: A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-22986: On BIG-IP versions 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.2.1, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, and 12.1.x before 12.1.5.3 amd BIG-IQ 7.1.0.x before 7.1.0.3 and 7.0.0.x before 7.0.0.2, the iControl REST interface has an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-26855: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-34473: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40604: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in IPS Community Suite before 4.6.2 allows remote authenticated users to request arbitrary URLs or trigger deserialization via phar protocol when generating class names dynamically. In some cases an exploitation is possible by an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1592: Server-Side Request Forgery in scout in GitHub repository clinical-genomics/scout prior to v4.42. An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attack to discover internal network topology base on query response.\n\n- CVE-2022-36997: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup 8.1.x through 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.x through 8.3.0.2, 9.x through 9.0.0.1, and 9.1.x through 9.1.0.1 (and related NetBackup products). An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nsentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentrys Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Pythons `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if its not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **bug in Sentry's Python SDK**\n- **impact:** pass environment variables to subprocesses\n- **product:** sentry-sdk\n- **version:** < 2.8.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40647:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-40647. It describes a vulnerability in the Sentry Python SDK that unintentionally exposes environment variables to subprocesses and links to the GitHub Security Advisory that includes the CVE ID.\n\n**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in how the Sentry Python SDK's `StdlibIntegration` handles the `env` argument when calling `subprocess.Popen`. When an empty dictionary `{}` was explicitly passed as the `env` argument to `subprocess.Popen`, the SDK incorrectly interpreted it as a `None` environment. Consequently, instead of passing an empty environment, the SDK passed the entire environment of the parent process to the subprocess.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Unintentional Environment Variable Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintended leakage of environment variables to child processes. This happens even when the user explicitly sets `env={}` in the `subprocess` call, intending to pass no environment variables.\n\n**4. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information stored in environment variables. If an attacker can influence the execution of a subprocess through the vulnerable Sentry SDK, they could gain access to sensitive data present in the environment of the parent process. This could include API keys, passwords, or other confidential information.\n\n**5. Attack vectors:**\n\n- **Subprocess Execution:** The attack vector involves a scenario where the application using the vulnerable Sentry SDK executes subprocesses using the Python `subprocess` module while also using the `StdlibIntegration` of the Sentry SDK. If the application is passing a specific `env` argument, the vulnerability would not be triggered.\n\n**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to have some control over the code being executed by the Python application to be able to trigger the spawning of a subprocess using the `subprocess` module with an empty `env` argument while the Sentry SDK's `StdlibIntegration` is enabled.\n- **Environment Access:** The attacker benefits most when the parent process' environment contains sensitive information that can be accessed by the spawned child process.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- **Affected Versions:** Sentry Python SDK versions prior to 2.8.0 are affected.\n- **Patched Versions:** The issue has been patched in versions 2.8.0 and 1.45.1.\n- **Workarounds:**\n    - Replace `env={}` with `env={\"EMPTY_ENV\": \"1\"}` or similar in application code.\n    - Disable the `StdlibIntegration` in the Sentry SDK initialization.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, offering a comprehensive view of the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.804 |\n| 2 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.790 |\n| 3 | 668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.785 |\n| 4 | 525 | Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.775 |\n| 5 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.772 |\n| 6 | 526 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.408 |\n| 7 | 942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.771 |\n| 9 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.770 |\n| 10 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.762 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.\n\n\nWhile this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering\n- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nResources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** A \"control sphere\" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for \"administrators\" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be \"users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed.\" Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not use an appropriate caching policy that specifies the extent to which each web page and associated form fields should be cached.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-524\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-526: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an environment variable to store unencrypted sensitive information.\n\n### Extended Description\nInformation stored in an environment variable can be accessible by other processes with the execution context, including child processes that dependencies are executed in, or serverless functions in cloud environments. An environment variable's contents can also be inserted into messages, headers, log files, or other outputs. Often these other dependencies have no need to use the environment variable in question. A weakness that discloses environment variables could expose this information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-312\nPeerOf -> CWE-214\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-43691:** CMS shows sensitive server-side information from environment variables when run in Debug mode.\n- **CVE-2022-27195:** Plugin for an automation server inserts environment variable contents into build XML files.\n- **CVE-2022-25264:** CI/CD tool logs environment variables related to passwords add Contribution to content history.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA cross-domain policy file (\"crossdomain.xml\" in Flash and \"clientaccesspolicy.xml\" in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.\n\n\nTherefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.\n\n\nAn overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker.

The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.\n\n- CVE-2021-33687: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\n- CVE-2021-3509: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4. Accessing the endpoint /api/version leaks internal information for the system, and this endpoint is not protected with authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-30156: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Special:Contributions can leak that a \"hidden\" user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-32731: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40862: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise up to v202108-1 contained an API endpoint that erroneously disclosed a sensitive URL to authenticated parties, which could be used for privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of a Terraform configuration. Fixed in v202109-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-41140: Discourse-reactions is a plugin for the Discourse platform that allows user to add their reactions to the post. In affected versions reactions given by user to secure topics and private messages are visible. This issue is patched in version 0.2 of discourse-reaction. Users who are unable to update are advised to disable the Discourse-reactions plugin in admin panel.\n\n- CVE-2021-37326: NetSarang Xshell 7 before Build 0077 includes unintended code strings in paste operations.\n\n- CVE-2020-13597: Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually. This issue affects: OTRS AG OTRSCustomContactFields 8.0.x version: 8.0.11 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-1595: The HC Custom WP-Admin URL WordPress plugin through 1.4 leaks the secret login URL when sending a specific crafted request\n\n- CVE-2022-21642: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion.

There is no workaround for this issue and users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-21712: twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python. In affected versions twisted exposes cookies and authorization headers when following cross-origin redirects. This issue is present in the `twited.web.RedirectAgent` and `twisted.web. BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24737: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27630: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_master_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi MS1G_00_01.00_14. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can send packets to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-27633: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_guest_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi MS1G_00_01.00_14.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents.

This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role).

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0).

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

The vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.\n\n- CVE-2021-24024: A clear text storage of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in FortiADCManager 5.3.0 and below, 5.2.1 and below and FortiADC 5.3.7 and below may allow a remote authenticated attacker to read other local users' password in log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-25284: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. salt.modules.cmdmod can log credentials to the info or error log level.\n\n- CVE-2021-3032: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where configuration secrets for the \u201chttp\u201d, \u201cemail\u201d, and \u201csnmptrap\u201d v3 log forwarding server profiles can be logged to the logrcvr.log system log. Logged information may include up to 1024 bytes of the configuration including the username and password in an encrypted form and private keys used in any certificate profiles set for log forwarding server profiles. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Customers with auto-upgrade enabled should already be on a fixed version while customers using on-prem connectors with auto-upgrade disabled are advised to upgrade to a fixed version.\n\n- CVE-2021-26999: NetApp Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.9.9 log sensitive information when an Active Directory connection fails. The logged information is available only to authenticated users. Customers with auto-upgrade enabled should already be on a fixed version while customers using on-prem connectors with auto-upgrade disabled are advised to upgrade to a fixed version.\n\n- CVE-2021-31546: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly logged sensitive suppression deletions, which should not have been visible to users with access to view AbuseFilter log data.\n\n- CVE-2021-3167: In Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) 1.3.0, JWT authentication tokens are exposed to administrators in virtual cluster server logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-39913: Accidental logging of system root password in the migration log in all versions of GitLab CE/EE before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 allows an attacker with local file system access to obtain system root-level privileges\n\n- CVE-2021-21722: A ZTE Smart STB is impacted by an information leak vulnerability. The device did not fully verify the log, so attackers could use this vulnerability to obtain sensitive user information for further information detection and attacks. This affects: ZXV10 B860A V2.1-T_V0032.1.1.04_jiangsuTelecom.\n\n- CVE-2021-22184: An information disclosure issue in GitLab starting from version 12.8 allowed a user with access to the server logs to see sensitive information that wasn't properly redacted.\n\n- CVE-2021-37036: There is an information leakage vulnerability in FusionCompute 6.5.1, eCNS280_TD V100R005C00 and V100R005C10. Due to the improperly storage of specific information in the log file, the attacker can obtain the information when a user logs in to the device. Successful exploit may cause the information leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-36318: Dell EMC Avamar versions 18.2,19.1,19.2,19.3,19.4 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A high privileged user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a complete outage.\n\n- CVE-2022-23506: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature. This issue impacts GlobalProtect App 5.2 versions earlier than 5.2.9 on Windows. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.\n\n- CVE-2022-0652: Confd log files contain local users', including root\u2019s, SHA512crypt password hashes with insecure access permissions. This allows a local attacker to attempt off-line brute-force attacks against these password hashes in Sophos UTM before version 9.710.\n\n- CVE-2022-0718: A flaw was found in python-oslo-utils. Due to improper parsing, passwords with a double quote ( \" ) in them cause incorrect masking in debug logs, causing any part of the password after the double quote to be plaintext.\n\n- CVE-2022-0725: A flaw was found in keepass. The vulnerability occurs due to logging the plain text passwords in system log and leads to an Information Exposure vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to interact and read sensitive passwords and logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20630: A vulnerability in the audit log of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. This vulnerability is due to the unsecured logging of sensitive information on an affected system. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs through the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information that includes user credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-33737: The OpenVPN Access Server installer creates a log file readable for everyone, which from version 2.10.0 and before 2.11.0 may contain a random generated admin password\n\n- CVE-2022-34826: In Couchbase Server 7.1.x before 7.1.1, an encrypted Private Key passphrase may be leaked in the logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20458: The logs of sensitive information (PII) or hardware identifier should only be printed in Android \"userdebug\" or \"eng\" build. StatusBarNotification.getKey() could contain sensitive information. However, CarNotificationListener.java, it prints out the StatusBarNotification.getKey() directly in logs, which could contain user's account name (i.e. PII), in Android \"user\" build.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-205567776\n\n- CVE-2022-20651: A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-3733: Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n\n- CVE-2005-0406: Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG.

This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-3681: A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in \"galaxy.yml\" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.\n\n- CVE-2021-3602: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).\n\n- CVE-2022-24719: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24798: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2818: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository cockpit-hq/cockpit prior to 2.2.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-25187: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.79 and earlier does not redact some sensitive information in the support bundle.\n\n- CVE-2022-0355: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM simple-get prior to 4.0.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-0536: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in NPM follow-redirects prior to 1.14.8. \n\n- CVE-2022-1650: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository eventsource/eventsource prior to v2.0.2. \n\n- CVE-2022-1893: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository polonel/trudesk prior to 1.2.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-31042: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n- CVE-2022-31043: Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are not expected or required.\n\n- CVE-2022-31090: Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n- CVE-2022-31112: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields.\n\n- CVE-2022-33740: Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n- CVE-2022-3460: In affected versions of Octopus Deploy it is possible for certain types of sensitive variables to inadvertently become unmasked when viewed in variable preview.\n\n- CVE-2022-4734: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.1. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-669 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-201 (CanPrecede)",

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum.

Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, and 3.6.5. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-24307: Mastodon before 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6 has incorrect access control because it does not compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. (JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.)\n\n- CVE-2022-24714: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products). An endpoint in the backend Tomcat server of the Pascom allows SSRF, a related issue to CVE-2019-18394.\n\n- CVE-2021-21973: The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue by sending a POST request to vCenter Server plugin leading to information disclosure. This affects: VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before 6.7 U3l and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and 3.x before 3.10.1.2).\n\n- CVE-2021-21975: Server Side Request Forgery in vRealize Operations Manager API (CVE-2021-21975) prior to 8.4 may allow a malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack to steal administrative credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-27103: Accellion FTA 9_12_411 and earlier is affected by SSRF via a crafted POST request to wmProgressstat.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_416 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-40438: A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-22986: On BIG-IP versions 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.2.1, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, and 12.1.x before 12.1.5.3 amd BIG-IQ 7.1.0.x before 7.1.0.3 and 7.0.0.x before 7.0.0.2, the iControl REST interface has an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-26855: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-34473: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40604: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in IPS Community Suite before 4.6.2 allows remote authenticated users to request arbitrary URLs or trigger deserialization via phar protocol when generating class names dynamically. In some cases an exploitation is possible by an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1592: Server-Side Request Forgery in scout in GitHub repository clinical-genomics/scout prior to v4.42. An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attack to discover internal network topology base on query response.\n\n- CVE-2022-36997: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup 8.1.x through 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.x through 8.3.0.2, 9.x through 9.0.0.1, and 9.1.x through 9.1.0.1 (and related NetBackup products). An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",
