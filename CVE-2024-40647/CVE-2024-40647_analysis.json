  "description": "sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentrys Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Pythons `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if its not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40647:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-40647. It describes a vulnerability in the Sentry Python SDK that unintentionally exposes environment variables to subprocesses and links to the GitHub Security Advisory that includes the CVE ID.\n\n**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in how the Sentry Python SDK's `StdlibIntegration` handles the `env` argument when calling `subprocess.Popen`. When an empty dictionary `{}` was explicitly passed as the `env` argument to `subprocess.Popen`, the SDK incorrectly interpreted it as a `None` environment. Consequently, instead of passing an empty environment, the SDK passed the entire environment of the parent process to the subprocess.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Unintentional Environment Variable Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintended leakage of environment variables to child processes. This happens even when the user explicitly sets `env={}` in the `subprocess` call, intending to pass no environment variables.\n\n**4. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information stored in environment variables. If an attacker can influence the execution of a subprocess through the vulnerable Sentry SDK, they could gain access to sensitive data present in the environment of the parent process. This could include API keys, passwords, or other confidential information.\n\n**5. Attack vectors:**\n\n- **Subprocess Execution:** The attack vector involves a scenario where the application using the vulnerable Sentry SDK executes subprocesses using the Python `subprocess` module while also using the `StdlibIntegration` of the Sentry SDK. If the application is passing a specific `env` argument, the vulnerability would not be triggered.\n\n**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to have some control over the code being executed by the Python application to be able to trigger the spawning of a subprocess using the `subprocess` module with an empty `env` argument while the Sentry SDK's `StdlibIntegration` is enabled.\n- **Environment Access:** The attacker benefits most when the parent process' environment contains sensitive information that can be accessed by the spawned child process.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- **Affected Versions:** Sentry Python SDK versions prior to 2.8.0 are affected.\n- **Patched Versions:** The issue has been patched in versions 2.8.0 and 1.45.1.\n- **Workarounds:**\n    - Replace `env={}` with `env={\"EMPTY_ENV\": \"1\"}` or similar in application code.\n    - Disable the `StdlibIntegration` in the Sentry SDK initialization.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, offering a comprehensive view of the vulnerability.",

CWE-200 and CWE-668 are broader classifications of information exposure. While technically applicable, they don't capture the specific mechanism of the vulnerability as precisely as CWE-214. The relationship between these CWEs is hierarchical: CWE-214 is a more specific case of CWE-200, which in turn is a more specific case of CWE-668. The choice of CWE-214 is based on the explicit detail of environment variables being passed to a subprocess.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe214 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **bug in Sentry's Python SDK** that leads to environment variables being unintentionally passed to subprocesses. This leads to potential **information disclosure** if the environment variables contain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary. The root cause is the **bug in Sentry's Python SDK** where the `env={}` setting is not correctly handled, leading to the unintended exposure of environment variables. The selection of CWE-214 is based on the evidence that the vulnerability involves invoking a process (subprocess) with visible sensitive information (environment variables). CWE-214 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. While other CWEs like CWE-200 and CWE-668 could be considered, they are more general and don't capture the specific mechanism of this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the passing of environment variables to subprocesses, which directly corresponds to CWE-214.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
