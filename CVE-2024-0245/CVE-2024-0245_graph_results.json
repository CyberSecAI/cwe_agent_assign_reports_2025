  "query": "A misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file in hamza417/inure before build97 allows for task hijacking. This vulnerability permits malicious applications to inherit permissions of the vulnerable app, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information. An attacker can create a malicious app that hijacks the legitimate Inure app, intercepting and stealing sensitive information when installed on the victims device. This issue affects all Android versions before Android 11.",
