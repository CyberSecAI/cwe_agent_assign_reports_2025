  "description": "A **misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file** in hamza417/inure before build97 allows for task hijacking. This vulnerability permits malicious applications to inherit permissions of the vulnerable app, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information. An attacker can create a malicious app that hijacks the legitimate Inure app, intercepting and stealing sensitive information when installed on the victims device. This issue affects all Android versions before Android 11.",

CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE that is more general but still applicable, while CWE-862 is relevant due to the potential for missing authorization checks after the misconfiguration. The relationship between these CWEs suggests a chain where the **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276) can lead to broader authorization issues (CWE-862) and resource access problems (CWE-732). The abstraction level influenced the selection, favoring the Base-level CWE-276 when supported by the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe732 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe276 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe732\n    cwe276 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file** (CWE-276) leading to the application having **incorrect default permissions**. This can then lead to **missing authorization checks** (CWE-862) for certain functionalities or resources. Consequently, it leads to **incorrect permission assignment for critical resources** (CWE-732), finally resulting in **exposure of sensitive information** and **task hijacking**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file**, which directly points to a permission-related issue. The Retriever Results suggested several relevant CWEs, including CWE-732 and CWE-862. However, the root cause evidence specifically mentions a **misconfiguration**, aligning well with CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions). This CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferable.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that while CWE-732 and CWE-862 are related, they are more consequences of the initial **incorrect default permissions**. Therefore, CWE-276 is the most accurate primary CWE.\n\nThe provided evidence is sufficient to justify this classification, with a confidence score of 0.7. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing both the root cause and potential impacts of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1286.49\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.397\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**CWE-276** (Incorrect Default Permissions) is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file**, which directly relates to how permissions are set during installation.

Security implications include unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential task hijacking.\n\n**CWE-732** (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered because the **misconfiguration** could lead to incorrect permissions being assigned to critical resources. However, it's a more general consequence of the root cause (CWE-276).\n\n**CWE-862** (Missing Authorization) was also considered, as the **incorrect permissions** might result in missing authorization checks for certain actions.
