The CVE reference provides more specific weaknesses (CWE-22, CWE-73, and CWE-552) which contribute to the overall access control issue. CWE-284 is a Pillar, while the others are Base. The base level weaknesses give details about the **improper access control**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Insufficient Protection of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|PeerOf| cwe73\n    cwe22 -->|PeerOf| cwe552\n    cwe73 -->|PeerOf| cwe552\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73,cwe552 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284). This leads to CWE-22, CWE-73, and CWE-552, which allows unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper access control**, as stated in the vulnerability description key phrases. The CVE reference confirms the presence of this weakness, which is mapped to CWE-284. Additionally, the CVE reference identifies CWE-22, CWE-73, and CWE-552 as contributing factors.\n\nThe analysis is heavily based on the CVE reference summary, which provides specific details about the weaknesses present in the `deploypackage.form.php` file.\n```text\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nImproper Access Control Vulnerability in deploypackage.form.php\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n- CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n- CWE-552: Insufficient Protection of Sensitive Data\n```\n\nThe graph relationships show that while CWE-284 is the primary issue, it is composed of other weaknesses that have a peer relationship, since they all cause the same vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the provided evidence. CWE-284 is the general **improper access control** issue, while CWE-22, CWE-73, and CWE-552 detail the underlying causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
