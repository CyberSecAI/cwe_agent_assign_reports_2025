# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-3504

## Vulnerability Description
An **improper access control** vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** delete projects within the organization
- **attacker:** admin
- **product:** lunary-ai/lunary
- **version:** up to and including 1.2.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a commit in the `lunary` repository on GitHub. The commit message "fix: set user to owner" and the code diff strongly suggest a vulnerability fix related to user role manipulation. Let's break down the changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user role update mechanism. Prior to the fix, it appears that any user with the `admin` role could potentially change another user's role to `owner`, which could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation and control over the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper authorization checks:** Before the fix, the application was not properly restricting who could modify user roles, specifically the `owner` role.
*   **Potential for privilege escalation:** An attacker could exploit the lack of authorization by promoting themselves or another malicious user to the `owner` role, gaining full control over the application and its resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete control over the application:** By elevating a user to the `owner` role, an attacker would likely gain complete control over the application, data, and other user accounts.
*   **Data breaches and manipulation:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even delete data.
*   **Service disruption:** The attacker could also disrupt the service and prevent legitimate users from accessing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated user with admin role:** An authenticated user with the `admin` role is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **API endpoint manipulation:** The attack would likely involve sending a crafted request to the user update API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have an account with the `admin` role within the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the API endpoint responsible for updating user roles.

**Code Diff Details:**

The provided diff shows the following changes in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/users.ts`:

*   A check is added to prevent users from setting the role to `owner` directly via the API:
    ```typescript
     if (role === "owner") {
        ctx.throw(403, "You cannot modify the owner role")
     }
    ```
*   A check is added to ensure only a user with `owner` or `admin` roles can perform the action:
   ```typescript
   if (!["owner", "admin"].includes(currentUser.role)) {
    // ... existing logic that throws an error
   }
  ```

These changes ensure that only `owner` or `admin` roles can modify user roles and that users are no longer able to directly modify the `owner` role.

**In Summary**

The provided commit addresses a critical vulnerability related to user role manipulation. An authenticated attacker with admin privileges could have used the API to modify user roles and potentially elevate themselves to the owner role, gaining full control of the system. The fix implements additional checks to restrict the ability to set the owner role to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
