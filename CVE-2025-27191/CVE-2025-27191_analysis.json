The retriever results suggest more specific CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication). However, the vulnerability description only mentions \"**Improper Access Control**\" without specifying whether the issue is related to authentication or authorization.

Therefore, the more general CWE-284 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the available information.
