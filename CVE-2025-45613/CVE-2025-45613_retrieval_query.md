# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-288

CanPrecede -> CWE-471
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.




## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Privacy violation
Privacy leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.







## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.

### Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.

**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.
- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
OOB read: Shorthand for "Out of bounds" read

### Relationships

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.
- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize "|" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.
