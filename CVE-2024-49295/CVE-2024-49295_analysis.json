The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is the \"Simple Testimonials Showcase WordPress plugin <= 1.1.6 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\". The weakness is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The description aligns perfectly with CWE-79, which is \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\". Given the direct match and explicit mention of XSS, CWE-79 is the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\nCWE-80 \"Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\" was considered because it is a variant of CWE-79. However, the description doesn't specify that the improper neutralization is limited to script-related HTML tags.
