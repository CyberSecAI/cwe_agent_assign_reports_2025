CWE-400 is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-770. Due to the limited information, a more specific CWE cannot be determined, but CWE-770 seems like a better fit than CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain appears to start with a **lack of limits on resource allocation** (CWE-770), leading to a potential **denial-of-service** (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a potential Remote Network Scanning (XSPA)/DoS. This suggests a resource exhaustion issue. However, the evidence is extremely limited due to the placeholder CVE description. The description only mentions \"Remote Network Scanning (XSPA)/DoS OVE-20230524-0013.\"\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation** that could lead to the DoS. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is considered as a secondary candidate because it's a broader category that includes resource exhaustion. The graph relationship shows that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating a more specific type of resource consumption issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is based on the assumption that the **DoS** is caused by a lack of proper throttling or limits on resource allocation. Without more information, a more precise mapping is not possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected* - This is focused on information exposure, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the description.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
