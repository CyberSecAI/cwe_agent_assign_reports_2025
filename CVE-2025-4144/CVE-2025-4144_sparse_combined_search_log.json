  "query": "PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of MCP framework https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped. Fixed in https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 Impact PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft.
