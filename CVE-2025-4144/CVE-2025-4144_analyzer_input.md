# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4144

## Vulnerability Description
PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of MCP framework https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped. Fixed in https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 Impact PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

This content relates to a PKCE downgrade attack mitigation, and while it doesn't directly reference a CVE ID, it links to RFC9700 which details the attack. Given the CVE ID is a placeholder, this is the most relevant information available.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) downgrade attack, as described in RFC9700. The details of the attack itself are not fully explained in this content, but the reference to RFC9700 provides further information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The weakness lies in the potential for an attacker to downgrade the PKCE mechanism, potentially allowing them to obtain an authorization code without possessing the corresponding code verifier.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 flow.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector involves manipulating the OAuth 2.0 authorization request to force a downgrade of the PKCE method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The pull request #27 merged into the `main` branch mitigates the PKCE downgrade attack. The specific code changes are not provided in this content, but the merge commit message indicates the issue has been addressed.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, this content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description. It identifies the specific type of attack (PKCE downgrade), references the relevant RFC for more information, and confirms that a fix has been implemented.
