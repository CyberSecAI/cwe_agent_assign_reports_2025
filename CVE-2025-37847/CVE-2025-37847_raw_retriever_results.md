# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37847
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved accel/ivpu Fix deadlock in ivpu_ms_cleanup() Fix deadlock in ivpu_ms_cleanup() by preventing runtime resume after file_priv->ms_lock is acquired. During a failure in runtime resume, a cold boot is executed, which calls ivpu_ms_cleanup_all(). This function calls ivpu_ms_cleanup() that acquires file_priv->ms_lock and causes the deadlock.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'deadlock'
