In this case, the **CSRF** leads to stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Therefore, CWE-352 is the root cause, and CWE-79 is a secondary weakness resulting from the **CSRF**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. A successful **CSRF** attack then leads to **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, resulting in stored **XSS**. The **CSRF** allows an attacker to force a user into performing actions that inject malicious scripts, which are then stored and executed, leading to the **XSS** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified both **CSRF** and **XSS** as potential weaknesses. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions both \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery**\" and \"**XSS, cross-site scripting**\". The CVE summary highlights that **CSRF** allows malicious actors to force privileged users to execute unwanted actions. Given the context, **CWE-352** is the root cause that enables the **XSS** vulnerability. The graph relationships show that **CSRF** can precede **XSS**, supporting this conclusion. **CWE-352** is a Compound weakness, and **CWE-79** is a Base weakness, providing appropriate levels of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
