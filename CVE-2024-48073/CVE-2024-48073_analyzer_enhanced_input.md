# Vulnerability Description

    sunniwell HT3300 before 1.0.0.B022.2 is vulnerable to ****Insecure Permissions****. The /usr/local/bin/update program, which is responsible for updating the software in the HT3300 device, is given the execution mode of sudo NOPASSWD. This program is vulnerable to a **command injection** vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to pass commands to this program via command line arguments to gain elevated root privileges.
