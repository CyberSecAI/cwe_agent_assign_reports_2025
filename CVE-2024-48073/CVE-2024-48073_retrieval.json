The /usr/local/bin/update program, which is responsible for updating the software in the HT3300 device, is given the execution mode of sudo NOPASSWD. This program is vulnerable to a **command injection** vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to pass commands to this program via command line arguments to gain elevated root privileges.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'Insecure Permissions', 'weakness': ['Insecure Permissions', 'command injection'], 'impact': 'execute commands as root', 'vector': 'command injection', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'sunniwell HT3300', 'version': 'before 1.0.0.B022.2', 'component': '/usr/local/bin/update program'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-48073:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe `/usr/local/bin/update` program on the Sunniwell HT3300 device is vulnerable to command injection due to improper handling of command-line arguments. Specifically, when the program is called with \"patch\" as the first argument and a second argument ending in \".run\", it splices the second argument into a command that is then executed.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n*   **Command Injection:** The program directly uses the second command-line argument in a system command without proper sanitization.\\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The program only checks if the second argument ends with \".run\" and does not validate its content.\\n*   **Privilege Management:** The `update` program is configured with sudo NOPASSWD, which allows any user to execute it with root privileges without needing to provide a password.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by exploiting the command injection vulnerability.\\n*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the device by escalating privileges.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device to execute the vulnerable program.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n*   The attacker must have a user account on the affected device.\\n*   The attacker must be able to execute commands on the device.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\nThe provided github page contains a detailed analysis of the vulnerability:\\n* The sudoers file allows the user to execute the `/usr/local/bin/update` program with NOPASSWD.\\n* Reverse engineering of the update binary shows that the `argv[1]` argument must be equal to \"patch\" and the last four characters of `argv[2]` must be equal to \".run\" to trigger the vulnerability.\\n* A demonstration is provided how to exploit this by injecting a command that creates a setuid bash binary which is then used to escalate privileges to root.\\n\\nThe gist file provides additional CVE information:\\n*   **Affected Product:** sunniwell - HT3300\\n*   **Affected Firmware Version:** Before 1.0.0.B022.2\\n*   **CWEs:** CWE-426 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-274 (Privilege Management).', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},
