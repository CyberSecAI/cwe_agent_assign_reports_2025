  "description": "The miniOrange Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) Pro Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **authentication bypass** in all versions up to, and including, 200.3.9. This is due to **insufficient verification** on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.",

The vulnerability is due to a separate weakness (insufficient verification) that bypasses authentication. |\n| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. It could apply, but CWE-305 is more specific. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. It could apply, but CWE-305 is more specific. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness), and the relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). CWE-305 is more specific than CWE-287, as it explicitly states that the authentication bypass occurs due to a separate, primary weakness, which aligns with the **insufficient verification** of the social login token.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient verification** of the user being returned by the social login token (the primary weakness). This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insufficient Verification**\n  - **Weakness:** **Authentication Bypass**\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insufficient verification** of the social login token. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication and authorization, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nHowever, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, it became clear that CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is the most appropriate choice. This is because the vulnerability involves an **authentication bypass** that is caused by a separate, primary weakness (**insufficient verification**). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **insufficient verification** makes it possible for attackers to bypass authentication and log in as any existing user.\n\nThe choice of CWE-305 is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which emphasizes the importance of identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and selecting the most specific CWE. CWE-305 is a more specific child of CWE-287, which makes it a better fit for this vulnerability.\n\nThe assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly identifies the **insufficient verification** as the root cause of the **authentication bypass**. The retriever results and the MITRE mapping guidance were used to confirm this assessment and to select the most appropriate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\nCWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\nCWE-287: Improper Authentication\nThe product does not adequately authenticate actors trying to access a resource, functionality, or data.\n\nCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.",
