  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function MDCImporterValidateSurfaceHeader of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp. The manipulation of the argument pcSurface2 leads to out-of-bounds read. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
