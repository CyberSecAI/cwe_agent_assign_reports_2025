This issue affects the function MDCImporterValidateSurfaceHeader of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp. The manipulation of the argument pcSurface2 leads to out-of-bounds read. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-129 CWE-121 CWE-79 CWE-126 CWE-89 CWE-190 CWE-787 CWE-125 CWE-122",
