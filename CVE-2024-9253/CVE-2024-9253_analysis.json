  "description": "Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24492.",

The **lack of proper validation** leads to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**. The **Out-of-bounds Read** results in **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the direct weakness exploited. The description clearly states \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer\".\n\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** because it directly reflects the **weakness** and the **impact** of the vulnerability, specifically that a read occurs beyond the intended buffer. The **root cause** is **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** as the **lack of proper validation** is what allows the out-of-bounds read to occur.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-125** is a Base CWE, providing a detailed description of the out-of-bounds read condition. **CWE-20** is a Class CWE and a higher level of abstraction, which can be a prerequisite of CWE-125.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
