# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9253

## Description

Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24492.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is an **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)**, which occurs due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This indicates that **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)** is a prerequisite.
CWE-125 is a base level CWE and accurately describes the vulnerability.
CWE-20 is a class level CWE and a higher level of abstraction, which can be a prerequisite of CWE-125.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**. The **lack of proper validation** leads to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**. The **Out-of-bounds Read** results in **Information Disclosure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the direct weakness exploited. The description clearly states "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer".

Based on the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** because it directly reflects the **weakness** and the **impact** of the vulnerability, specifically that a read occurs beyond the intended buffer. The **root cause** is **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** as the **lack of proper validation** is what allows the out-of-bounds read to occur.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-125** is a Base CWE, providing a detailed description of the out-of-bounds read condition. **CWE-20** is a Class CWE and a higher level of abstraction, which can be a prerequisite of CWE-125.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.

*Not Selected*: This is too specific, and **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** is a better fit.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected as Primary CWE*: This is the most accurate CWE to represent the **Out-of-Bounds Read** vulnerability.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is too specific, as the vulnerability isn't necessarily related to array indices.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: The vulnerability isn't directly caused by incorrect calculation of buffer size.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: While the **impact** is information disclosure, the direct cause is **Out-of-bounds Read**.

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: Too generic.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.
