## Vulnerability Description
The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins button shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.8 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE The vulnerable code in this plugin is specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme. If another theme is installed (e.g., NewsMag), this code may not be present.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** inject arbitrary web scripts
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 4.8
- **component:** plugins button shortcode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the tagDiv Composer plugin's button shortcode. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the button shortcode, enabling the storage of malicious scripts within the website's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within a page.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** Once injected, the malicious script can be executed every time a user visits an affected page.
- **Data Theft & Malicious Redirects:** The executed script can steal user session cookies, perform actions on the user's behalf, redirect users to malicious sites, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Button Shortcode:** The attack is initiated through the plugin's button shortcode.
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker injects malicious code into the attributes of the button shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website.
- **Plugin Specific:** The vulnerable code is specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme, so the attacker needs to target a website using it along with the vulnerable plugin.
