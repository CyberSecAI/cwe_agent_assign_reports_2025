# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-3888
## Query
The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins button shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE The vulnerable code in this plugin is specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme. If another theme is installed (e.g., NewsMag), this code may not be present.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient input sanitization', 'output escaping on user supplied attributes'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting'
