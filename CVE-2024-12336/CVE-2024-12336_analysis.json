It describes the general case where a product does not perform an authorization check. While there might be more specific Base-level children of CWE-862, the provided vulnerability description focuses on the **missing capability check**, which directly aligns with the concept of **missing authorization**.\n\nCWE-359, **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, is considered a secondary weakness because it describes the impact of the primary weakness, but it isn't the root cause. It highlights the consequence of the **missing authorization**, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|IMPACTOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862), leading to unauthorized access to the `export_all_data` function. This, in turn, leads to the exposure of sensitive affiliate data, including PII (CWE-359). The chain can be summarized as:\n\n1.  **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The root cause is the **lack of** an authorization check on the `export_all_data` function.\n2.  **Exposure of Private Personal Information (CWE-359):** The impact is the unauthorized exposure of sensitive data due to the **missing authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the **missing capability check**. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also indicate CWE-862 as a top candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-359 is an impact of CWE-862, reinforcing the choice of CWE-862 as the primary root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, but it accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability. More specific Base-level children of CWE-862 might exist, but the description doesn't provide enough details to warrant their selection. CWE-359 describes the specific impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
