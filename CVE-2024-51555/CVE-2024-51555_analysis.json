CWE-1392 is a Base level CWE, which is more specific than its parent, CWE-1391 (Class).

The root cause is the **use of default credentials** because the system does not require the installer to change them.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1392 because the vulnerability description explicitly states the issue is related to **default credentials** not being changed. The system's design does not force the changing of **default credentials**, leading to a security vulnerability. CWE-306 is a secondary concern, as it sets the stage for CWE-1392.
