  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-50252', description='In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mlxsw spectrum_ipip Fix **memory leak** when changing remote IPv6 address The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in linear memory that is managed by the driver. Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would result in a warning [2] and a **memory leak** [3]. The problem is that the new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it. Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of the address and then decreasing it.

When changing the remote IPv6 address of an ip6gre network device, the driver does not remove the old address from its hash table or add the new address.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory leak occurs because the old IPv6 address is not released when a new one is configured. Additionally, the new address isn't correctly added to the hash table, which could lead to incorrect routing or encapsulation.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion over time. Also, incorrect address mapping due to the failure to update the hash table could lead to unpredictable network behavior.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying the remote IPv6 address of an ip6gre network device via the `ip link` command.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to configure network devices to exploit the vulnerability.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mlxsw spectrum_ipip Fix **memory leak** when changing remote IPv6 address The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in linear memory that is managed by the driver. Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would result in a warning [2] and a **memory leak** [3]. The problem is that the new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it. Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of the address and then decreasing it.
