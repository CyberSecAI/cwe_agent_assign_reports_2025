# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50252

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mlxsw spectrum_ipip Fix **memory leak** when changing remote IPv6 address The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in linear memory that is managed by the driver. Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would result in a warning [2] and a **memory leak** [3]. The problem is that the new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it. Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of the address and then decreasing it.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime**, which directly relates to the reported **memory leak**. **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is also relevant because the **driver allocates memory for IPv6 addresses without properly managing their release**, which can lead to excessive resource consumption.
**CWE-401** is a child of **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**, indicating a more specific case of resource management failure. **CWE-770** is a child of **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**. This parent-child structure guides the selection towards the more descriptive base-level CWEs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper management of IPv6 addresses** when the remote address of an ip6gre net device is changed. The old address is not removed from the hash table, and the new address is not added, which leads to a **memory leak**. This **memory leak** is a direct result of failing to release the **allocated memory**, and eventually, this can cause system instability or a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **failure to release memory**, which directly corresponds to **CWE-401**. The analysis considered the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770)**. The retriever identified several potential CWEs, but the memory leak and resource management context made **CWE-401** and **CWE-770** the most fitting.
The relationships between CWEs guided the selection toward base-level weaknesses that are more descriptive. The evidence clearly points to a **memory leak** due to the failure to release **allocated memory**, justifying the selection of **CWE-401** as the primary CWE. The allocation of resources without proper limits contributed to the **memory leak**, so **CWE-770** is a secondary CWE.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
