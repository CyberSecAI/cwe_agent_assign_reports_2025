  "query": "A vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of client key data after the TLS session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to an affected system over the secure TLS session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
