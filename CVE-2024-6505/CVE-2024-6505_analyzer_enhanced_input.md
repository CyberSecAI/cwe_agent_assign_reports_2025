# Vulnerability Description

    A flaw was found in the virtio-net device in QEMU. When enabling the RSS feature on the virtio-net network card, the indirections_table data within RSS becomes controllable. Setting excessively large values may cause an **index out-of-bounds** issue, potentially resulting in **heap overflow** access. This flaw allows a privileged user in the guest to crash the QEMU process on the host.
