The vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a direct result of the missing limits. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) - Missing input validation allows for the excessive resource allocation.\n3.  **Impact:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) - Excessive resource allocation leads to resource exhaustion.\n4.  Denial of Service (DoS) - The resource exhaustion causes the application to crash, resulting in a DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper handling of user supplied input** which leads to allocation of resources without limits or throttling. This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and eventually a Denial of Service. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a contributing factor as the **improper handling of user supplied input** is the reason why an attacker can cause the resource exhaustion.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"An Unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in Flowise version 1.8.2 leading to a complete crash of the instance running a vulnerable version due to **improper handling of user supplied input** to the /api/v1/get-upload-file api endpoint.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting how the lack of input validation can lead to uncontrolled resource allocation.\n\nCWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the missing limits and throttling mechanisms when allocating resources.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered because the **improper handling of user supplied input** is the reason why an attacker can cause the resource exhaustion but it's a class level abstraction.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered because the vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a direct result of the missing limits.
