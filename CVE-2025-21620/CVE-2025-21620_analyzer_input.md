# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21620

## Vulnerability Description
Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. When you send a request with the Authorization header to one domain, and the response asks to redirect to a different domain, Denosfetch() redirect handling creates a follow-up redirect request that keeps the original Authorization header, leaking its content to that second domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** leaking the Authorization header content
- **product:** Deno
- **component:** redirect handling in Denosfetch()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-21620 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-21620. It provides detailed information about a vulnerability in Deno.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Deno's `fetch()` redirect handling does not drop the `Authorization` header when redirecting to a cross-origin domain. This leaks the authorization information to the second domain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-200:** Improper Input Validation (specifically, not dropping sensitive headers during cross-origin redirects).

**Impact of exploitation:**

Leaking of `Authorization` headers to unintended domains during cross-origin redirects, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure.  Confidentiality is rated as High in the CVSS score.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   An attacker can trigger a redirect from a domain where the user is authenticated (with an `Authorization` header) to a different domain they control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No privileges required.
*   No user interaction required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control a server that can respond with a redirect to a different origin.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Patched in Deno versions >=2.1.2
*   `deno_fetch` >=0.204.0

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The content includes a reproduction example using `Deno.serve` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   It references the expected behavior according to the Fetch specification ([https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-cors-non-wildcard-request-header-name](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-cors-non-wildcard-request-header-name)).
*   It includes a CVSS v3 score and breakdown of the metrics (7.5/10).
*   It mentions that Deno does not enforce the same-origin policy and lacks a cookie jar, but notes this doesn't negate the need to protect against leaking authenticated data.
*   Credits the reporter (@rexxars).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
