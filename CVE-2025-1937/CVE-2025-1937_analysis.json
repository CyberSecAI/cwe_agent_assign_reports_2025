CWE-787 is a more specific type of CWE-119. The \"Memory safety bugs\" and \"memory corruption\" details from the vulnerability description points to memory corruption issues. The Retriever Results also indicates that CWE-787 is a strong candidate.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with memory safety bugs leading to memory corruption, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n  - Root Cause: Memory Safety Bugs\n  - Weakness: Memory Corruption\n  - Impact: Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description mentions \"memory safety bugs\" and \"memory corruption\". The retriever results point to CWE-787 as a strong candidate, which aligns with the description of memory corruption due to writing outside buffer boundaries. I considered CWE-119 as a parent class, but CWE-787 is more specific and matches the vulnerability details better.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-787 is based on the following evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**memory corruption, memory safety bugs**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Memory safety bugs present...
