# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12483

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Dromara UJCMS up to 9.6.3. This affects an unknown part of the file /users/id of the component User ID Handler. The manipulation leads to authorization bypass. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** authorization bypass
- **product:** Dromara UJCMS
- **version:** up to 9.6.3
- **component:** /users/id of the User ID Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The application lacks proper access controls on the `/users/id` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to access user information using arbitrary IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The application uses predictable user IDs directly in the URL, enabling attackers to access different user accounts by manipulating these IDs.
- Authorization Bypass: There is no check to verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to access the user information being requested.
- Information Disclosure: The server returns specific error messages ("User not found. ID: your supplied ID") which allow an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid user IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- User enumeration: Attackers can systematically discover valid usernames by trying different IDs and observing the server responses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct request to the `/users/id` endpoint with manipulated user IDs via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability and only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided text offers more details than a standard CVE description would, including:
- The specific endpoint affected (`/users/id`).
- The method to identify valid IDs based on the response.
- The specific version affected (9.6.3).
- A detailed list of mitigation recommendations.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
