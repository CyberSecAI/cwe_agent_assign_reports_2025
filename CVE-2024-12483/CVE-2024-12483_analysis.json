  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Dromara UJCMS up to 9.6.3. This affects an unknown part of the file /users/id of the component User ID Handler. The manipulation leads to authorization bypass. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe application lacks proper access controls on the `/users/id` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to access user information using arbitrary IDs.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The application uses predictable user IDs directly in the URL, enabling attackers to access different user accounts by manipulating these IDs.\n- Authorization Bypass: There is no check to verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to access the user information being requested.\n- Information Disclosure: The server returns specific error messages (\"User not found. ID: your supplied ID\") which allow an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid user IDs.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- User enumeration: Attackers can systematically discover valid usernames by trying different IDs and observing the server responses.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Direct request to the `/users/id` endpoint with manipulated user IDs via HTTP requests.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability and only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\nThe provided text offers more details than a standard CVE description would, including:\n- The specific endpoint affected (`/users/id`).\n- The method to identify valid IDs based on the response.\n- The specific version affected (9.6.3).\n- A detailed list of mitigation recommendations.",

This is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. Several other CWEs were considered, particularly those related to missing or incorrect authorization. The relationship analysis focused on finding the CWE that best represented the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the ability to bypass authorization by manipulating user IDs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper access control on the `/users/id` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to access user information by manipulating IDs. This leads to an authorization bypass and potential information disclosure.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing authorization** and **user-controlled key** leading to authorization bypass\nImpact: Information Disclosure, User Enumeration\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the vulnerability involves an **authorization bypass** due to the ability to manipulate user IDs. The key phrase is \"manipulation leads to authorization bypass\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states \"The application lacks proper access controls on the `/users/id` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to access user information using arbitrary IDs.\" The retriever results also included CWE-639, which aligns with this assessment.\n\nCWE-639 is the most specific and appropriate choice because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **ability to bypass authorization by manipulating the user-controlled key (user ID)**.
