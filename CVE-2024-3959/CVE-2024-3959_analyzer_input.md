# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-3959

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 16.7 prior to 16.11.5, starting from 17.0 prior to 17.0.3, and starting from 17.1 prior to 17.1.1, which allows private job artifacts can be accessed by any user.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** private job artifacts can be accessed by any user
- **product:** GitLab CE/EE
- **version:** all versions starting from 16.7 prior to 16.11.5, starting from 17.0 prior to 17.0.3, and starting from 17.1 prior to 17.1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to access private job artifacts through the `needs` keyword in GitLab CI/CD pipelines, despite the artifacts being explicitly set as private using the `artifacts:public: false` setting. This indicates that the access control mechanism for `needs` dependencies was not properly enforcing the privacy settings of artifacts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken access control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce access restrictions on private job artifacts when accessed via the `needs` keyword in another pipeline.
- **Data leakage:** Private data, intended to be restricted to authorized users, is unintentionally exposed through this mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can gain access to private job artifacts, potentially exposing sensitive information such as environment variables, API keys, passwords, and other confidential data contained within those artifacts.
- **Security Breach:** The exposure of sensitive information can lead to further security breaches, such as unauthorized access to systems and resources, or the compromise of the integrity of data and processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves creating a new GitLab CI/CD pipeline in a separate project that uses the `needs` keyword to declare a dependency on a job in the victim's project that produces private artifacts.
- By specifying the victim's project and job, along with `artifacts: true`, an attacker can trigger the pipeline and obtain the private artifact data, even without authorization to directly access it from the victim project.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to GitLab instance and be able to create projects and CI/CD pipelines.
- The attacker doesn't require any specific level of access or prior authorization to the victim project, other than the ability to view its public details (such as project name, job names).
- The attacker needs to know the name of the victim's project and the job that generates the private artifact.
