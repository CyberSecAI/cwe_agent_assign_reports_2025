# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21973

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved eth bnxt fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats from sw_stats in the rings. But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up. So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down. The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However, the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring without null check. So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down. Reproducer ip link set $interface down ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get OR ip link set $interface down python ./stats.py Splat looks like

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **bnxt_get_queue_stats accesses tx_ring and cp_ring without null check**
- **impact:** kernel panic
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}
