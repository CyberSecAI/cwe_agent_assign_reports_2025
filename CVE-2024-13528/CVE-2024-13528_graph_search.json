  "query": "The Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.5. This is due to the presence of a shortcode that will generate a confirmation link with a placeholder email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to generate a verification link for any unverified user and log into the account. The Fine tune placement option must be enabled in the plugin settings in order to exploit the vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1390 CWE-863 CWE-306 CWE-302 CWE-472 CWE-352 CWE-285 CWE-940 CWE-289",
