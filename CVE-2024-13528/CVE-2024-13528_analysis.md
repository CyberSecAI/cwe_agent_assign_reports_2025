# Analysis for CVE-2024-13528

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Class |  Primary CWE | Discouraged |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE selected is CWE-287, Improper Authentication, a Class-level CWE. While it's discouraged to use Class-level CWEs when more specific Base-level CWEs exist, the description indicates a flaw in the overall authentication process, making it a reasonable starting point.

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific case where authentication is entirely absent. This is a potential secondary candidate if the evidence supports a complete lack of authentication.

CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is another potential candidate but is less likely since the initial issue appears to be in authentication rather than authorization after a successful login.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with an **authentication bypass** due to a shortcode that generates a confirmation link with a placeholder email. This allows an attacker to generate a verification link for any unverified user and log into the account.

1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287) due to a flawed verification process.
2.  **Impact:** **Authentication Bypass**, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment points towards **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description states "**Authentication Bypass**" and mentions that authenticated attackers can generate verification links for any unverified user, indicating a fundamental flaw in how the application verifies user identities.

The guidance states that "authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children". However, the vulnerability description refers to "Authentication Bypass" which implies there is an attempt at authentication, but it is flawed. Therefore, CWE-287 is more applicable.

The retriever results also listed CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, as a potential candidate, along with CWE-862, Missing Authorization. CWE-306 is applicable only if there is no authentication at all. CWE-862 is less likely, as the main problem is the **authentication bypass**, not the authorization after a successful login.

The final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-287, Improper Authentication, due to the authentication bypass enabled by a flawed verification process.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
