  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Tmall Demo up to 20250505. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function uploadProductImage of the file tmall/admin/uploadProductImage. The manipulation of the argument File leads to unrestricted upload. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
