  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Tmall Demo up to 20250505. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function uploadProductImage of the file tmall/admin/uploadProductImage. The manipulation of the argument File leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5130 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe code lacks proper filtering and detection of file names and file content during the upload process. The system also supports JSP parsing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.\n*   Lack of file type validation.\n*   Lack of file content scanning for malicious code.\n*   JSP parsing enabled, allowing execution of uploaded scripts.\n*   Predictable file paths after upload.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can upload malicious files (webshells, viruses, malicious scripts) to gain control of the server or steal sensitive information. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary command execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Uploading a malicious file (e.g., JSP webshell) through the `tmall/admin/uploadCategoryImage` interface.\n*   Accessing the uploaded file and triggering its execution.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker with network access to the vulnerable interface.\n*   Ability to craft a malicious file (e.g., JSP webshell).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Strictly limit allowed file types to specific, safe formats.\n*   Validate file header information.\n*   Restrict permissions on the upload directory to prevent script execution.\n*   Use random file names for uploaded files.\n*   Perform content scanning on uploaded files to detect malicious code.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific details about the vulnerable interface (`tmall/admin/uploadCategoryImage`), the ability to upload JSP files and execute commands, and proof-of-concept information with screenshots. The affected product is identified as <https://gitee.com/project_team/Tmall_demo>.",

CWE-646 [CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File] is a more specific variant that could contribute to the root cause.

This aligns with the CWE's definition of allowing the upload of dangerous file types. The retriever results also support **CWE-434** as a strong candidate.\n\nThe selection is further strengthened by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which mentions:\n\n*   Lack of file type validation.\n*   Lack of file content scanning for malicious code.\n*   JSP parsing enabled, allowing execution of uploaded scripts.\n\nThese points directly relate to the dangers described in **CWE-434**.\n\n**CWE-646** is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability might involve relying on the file name or extension, which is a common weakness in file upload implementations.\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly alter the decision, but they provided context on how **CWE-434** relates to other file handling and security issues.
