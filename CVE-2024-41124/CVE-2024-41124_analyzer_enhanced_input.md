## Vulnerability Description
Puncia is the Official CLI utility for Subdomain Center & Exploit Observer. `API_URLS` is utilizing HTTP instead of HTTPS for communication that can lead to issues like Eavesdropping, Data Tampering, Unauthorized Data Access & MITM Attacks. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.21 by using https rather than http connections. All users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS**
- **impact:** Eavesdropping, Data Tampering, Unauthorized Data Access & MITM Attacks
- **product:** Puncia
- **version:** before 0.21

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `API_URLS` in the `puncia` Python package were using HTTP instead of HTTPS, which allowed for cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information over HTTP.
- Lack of encryption for API communications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Eavesdropping on API communications.
- Data tampering.
- Unauthorized data access.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Potential exposure of API keys and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically MITM attacks.
- An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the API server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between the client using the `puncia` package and the API servers it communicates with.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or be able to intercept network communications (e.g., by controlling a network router or using ARP spoofing).
- No specific user privileges on the target system are required, but the attacker needs a position in the network path.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #8 of the `puncia` repository.
- The fix was implemented in commit `033f3b6`, which changed the `API_URLS` from HTTP to HTTPS.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `puncia` prior to 0.21.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity with a CVSS v3 score of 3.8.
- The advisory was published as GHSA-rwcj-7jjp-4w38.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).
