# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45258

## Vulnerability Description
The req package before 3.43.4 for Go may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided, because cleanHost in http.go intentionally uses a garbage in, garbage out design.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **garbage in garbage out design in cleanHost in http.go**
- **impact:** send unintended request
- **vector:** malformed URL
- **product:** req package for Go
- **version:** before 3.43.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent URL parsing between the `net/url` package and the `req` library. Specifically, the `req` library does not correctly handle malformed URLs containing certain special characters, particularly those that appear visually similar to standard characters. This discrepancy allows an attacker to bypass URL blocklists or sanitization implemented using the standard `net/url` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent URL Parsing:** The primary vulnerability is the difference in how `net/url` and `req` parse URLs, leading to `req` potentially sending requests to unintended hosts even when the URL appears to be blocked.
*   **Bypassing Blocklists:**  Due to the parsing differences,  malformed URLs with visually similar characters can bypass blocklists, which rely on `net/url` parsing for validation.
*   **Host Header Manipulation:** Although not the primary vector, the `Host` header is manipulated which could be a vulnerability in some circumstances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can potentially make requests to internal or unintended external resources.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios, SSRF can be leveraged to achieve RCE on vulnerable applications or systems.
*   **Unintended Behavior:** Applications using the `req` library may exhibit unexpected behavior due to the library making requests to the wrong destinations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed URLs:** The attack vector is the use of malformed URLs that contain special Unicode characters or other encodings that are interpreted differently by the `net/url` package and the `req` library. This includes a variety of characters that may look like normal ASCII characters (e.g., using fullwidth characters or look-alike characters)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to control or influence the URLs that are passed to the application using the vulnerable `req` library.
*   The attacker must be able to craft malicious URLs that bypass the URL validation/sanitization logic.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position if the vulnerability is exploitable via a web interface.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `req` version 3.43.3, and a fix was released in version 3.43.4.
*   The provided PoC includes a code sample demonstrating the vulnerability and a list of various payloads for different operating systems.
*   The attacker's comment mentions the issue was assigned CVE-2023-24329 and CVE-2024-22243. However, since the CVE provided for analysis is CVE-2024-45258, it is likely that this CVE is intended to address the same underlying issue. The provided content doesn't specify the precise relationship between these CVEs.
* The fix for the issue is in commit `04e3ece5b380ecad9da3551c449f1b8a9aa76d3d`.
*   The code diff highlights that the vulnerability is fixed by validating the `Host` header using `httpguts.ValidHostHeader(host)` and removing the `cleanHost` function from the `transport.go` file.

**Summary:**

The `req` library, before version 3.43.4, is vulnerable to inconsistent URL parsing, allowing attackers to bypass URL sanitization/blocklists and potentially cause SSRF or RCE vulnerabilities. The core issue lies in how `req` interprets malformed URLs containing visually-similar special characters compared to `net/url`. The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting such malicious URLs. The fix involves validating the Host header.
