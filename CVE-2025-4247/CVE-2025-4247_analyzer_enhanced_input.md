## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Simple To-Do List System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /delete_task.php. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** SourceCodester Simple To-Do List System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /delete_task.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4247.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

On the ninth line of the `delete_task.php` file, the `$id` variable, which contains user input, is used directly in a database query without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain database privileges, potentially leading to access to a large amount of data or even server host privileges if the database user has DBA rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `delete_task.php` file.
*   An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in a request to this file to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `delete_task.php` file. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper sanitization or validation of the `$id` variable before using it in the database query is necessary to prevent SQL injection.

**POC:**

`python3 sqlmap.py -u <http://localhost/delete_task.php?id=1> --dbms=mysql --technique=T`

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the line number in the vulnerable file and a proof-of-concept exploit using `sqlmap`.
