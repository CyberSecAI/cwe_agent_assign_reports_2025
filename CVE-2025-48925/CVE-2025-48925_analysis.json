  "description": "The TeleMessage service through 2025-05-05 relies on the client side (e.g., the TM SGNL app) to do MD5 hashing, and then accepts the hash as the authentication credential, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content:\n\nThe content discusses a security breach of TeleMessage, a Signal clone application. The breach involved a misconfiguration that allowed a hacker to access sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, and plaintext chat logs.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The archive server of TeleMessage was misconfigured, exposing the heap dump endpoint to the public internet.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Weak password hashing (MD5).\n    *   Exposed heap dump endpoint.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   The hacker could read usernames and passwords.\n    *   The hacker could read plaintext chat logs.\n    *   Compromised one of their federal government customers, along with one of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting a publicly accessible heap dump endpoint.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the internet and the ability to use tools like feroxbuster to discover the vulnerable URL.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The article mentions that TeleMessage has temporarily suspended all services. Potential fixes include:\n    *   Properly configuring the Spring Boot Actuator to restrict access to sensitive endpoints like the heap dump.\n    *   Using a more secure password hashing algorithm.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the official CVE description would.",
