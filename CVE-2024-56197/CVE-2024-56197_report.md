# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-56197

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-56197

## Description

Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. PM titles and metadata can be read by other users when the PM tags allowed for groups option is enabled, the other user is a member of a group added to this option, and the PM has been tagged. This issue has been patched in the latest `stable`, `beta` and `tests-passed` versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should remove all groups from the the PM tags allowed for groups option.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** PM tags allowed for groups option enabled
- **Impact:** read PM titles and metadata
- **Attacker:** other users
- **Product:** Discourse

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Class | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to PM titles and metadata. |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability stems from incorrect authorization because PM titles and metadata can be read by other users when the PM tags allowed for groups option is enabled. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is between CWE-200 and CWE-863. CWE-200 represents the exposure of sensitive information (PM titles and metadata), while CWE-863 describes the underlying authorization issue that allows this exposure. CWE-200 is a child of CWE-538 and CWE-359, indicating that the exposure happens within a broader context of sensitive information handling. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, suggesting that more specific authorization flaws might exist.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **PM tags allowed for groups option enabled**, leading to incorrect authorization (CWE-863).
2.  **Weakness:** Improper access control.
3.  **Impact:** Other users can read PM titles and metadata (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, several CWEs were considered, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). However, after reviewing the vulnerability description and related information, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) was identified as the primary weakness because the core issue is that private message titles and metadata are being exposed to unauthorized users. The vulnerability description explicitly states that PM titles and metadata can be read by other users, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-200.
CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a secondary candidate because the exposure is a result of **incorrect** authorization settings related to the PM tags feature. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data).

The selection of CWE-200 and CWE-863 are at the appropriate level of specificity, as they accurately represent the vulnerability without being overly generic or granular.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 884.78
