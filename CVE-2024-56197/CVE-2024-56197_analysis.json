The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to PM titles and metadata. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability stems from incorrect authorization because PM titles and metadata can be read by other users when the PM tags allowed for groups option is enabled. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is between CWE-200 and CWE-863. CWE-200 represents the exposure of sensitive information (PM titles and metadata), while CWE-863 describes the underlying authorization issue that allows this exposure. CWE-200 is a child of CWE-538 and CWE-359, indicating that the exposure happens within a broader context of sensitive information handling. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, suggesting that more specific authorization flaws might exist.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe359\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe538,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **PM tags allowed for groups option enabled**, leading to incorrect authorization (CWE-863).\n2.  **Weakness:** Improper access control.\n3.  **Impact:** Other users can read PM titles and metadata (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). However, after reviewing the vulnerability description and related information, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) was identified as the primary weakness because the core issue is that private message titles and metadata are being exposed to unauthorized users. The vulnerability description explicitly states that PM titles and metadata can be read by other users, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-200.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a secondary candidate because the exposure is a result of **incorrect** authorization settings related to the PM tags feature. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data).\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 and CWE-863 are at the appropriate level of specificity, as they accurately represent the vulnerability without being overly generic or granular.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
