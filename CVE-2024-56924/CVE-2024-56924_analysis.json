  "description": "A **Cross Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability in Code Astro Internet banking system 2.0.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the admin page (pages_account), potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as changing account settings or stealing sensitive user information. This vulnerability occurs due to **improper validation of user requests**, which enables attackers to exploit the system by tricking the admin user into executing malicious scripts.",

CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is added as a secondary weakness because the CSRF vulnerability leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. While CWE-79 is a child of CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer], this relationship does not directly impact the mapping as CWE-79 is directly related to the described impact.
