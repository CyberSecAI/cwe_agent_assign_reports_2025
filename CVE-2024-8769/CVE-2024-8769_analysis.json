  "description": "A vulnerability in the `LockManager.release_locks` function in aimhubio/aim (commit bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through **relative path traversal**. The `run_hash` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the `Repo._close_run()` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.",

CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is a related weakness, as it describes the broader issue of allowing user-controlled input to influence file operations. CWE-23 is more specific, focusing on **relative path traversal**, making it a better fit for the described vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe23 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user-controllable `run_hash` parameter. Because of the **relative path traversal** (**weakness**), this parameter is concatenated without normalization into a file path. This leads to arbitrary file deletion (**impact**). The chain is: User Input -> **Relative Path Traversal** -> Arbitrary File Deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-23 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**relative path traversal**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also list CWE-23 and CWE-22 as top candidates. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-23 is a more specific child of CWE-22, making it a better fit.\n\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description is sufficient to support this classification. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `run_hash` parameter is concatenated without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to use \"**../**\" sequences to traverse directories and delete arbitrary files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
