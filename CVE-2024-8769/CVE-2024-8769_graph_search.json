The `run_hash` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the `Repo._close_run()` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.
