Affected by this vulnerability is the function cgi_FMT_Std2R5_2nd_DiskMGR of the file /cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi. The manipulation of the argument f_source_dev leads to **command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `cgi_FMT_Std2R5_2nd_DiskMGR` function within the `/cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi` file of D-Link NAS devices.\n*   The `f_source_dev` variable, obtained from a POST request, is incorporated into a command executed by the `system()` function. This is done via `sprintf` without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate the input received in the `f_source_dev` parameter before using it in a system command.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit would give an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, potentially leading to:\n    *   Complete system compromise\n    *   Data theft\n    *   Malware installation\n    *   Denial-of-service\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious POST request to `/cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi` and including a crafted payload in the `f_source_dev` parameter.\n*   **Web Configuration Interface:** The vulnerable function is part of the device's web configuration interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected D-Link NAS device, potentially requiring:\n    *   Being on the same local network\n    *   Access through exposed ports/services on the internet, if the device is directly exposed.\n*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The affected devices are end-of-life (EOL) and are no longer supported by D-Link, meaning no official patches will be released to address this issue.\n*   D-Link recommends retiring and replacing the affected devices.\n*   The vulnerability is present in all firmware versions of the affected models.\n*   This vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2024-3273](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3273?ref=news.risky.biz).\n*   The information provided by the VulDB community submission aligns with the information in the D-Link Security Advisory.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by multiple sources, including VulDB CNA Team, Netsefish, and BuaaIOTTeam.",

The evidence clearly indicates that the `f_source_dev` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a `system()` call.\n\nThe Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-78 as the top match, further solidifying the decision. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for identifying root causes.\n\nThe final decision to map CWE-78 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**command injection**\".\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `f_source_dev` parameter is used in a `system()` call without proper sanitization.\n*   The Retriever Results identified CWE-78 as the top match.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause of the vulnerability**, which is the **improper neutralization of special elements in an OS command**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
