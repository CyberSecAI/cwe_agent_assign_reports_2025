Affected by this vulnerability is the function cgi_FMT_Std2R5_2nd_DiskMGR of the file /cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi. The manipulation of the argument f_source_dev leads to command injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",
