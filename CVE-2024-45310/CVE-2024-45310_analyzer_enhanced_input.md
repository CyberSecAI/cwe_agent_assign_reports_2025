## Vulnerability Description
runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attacks scope but the exact scope of protection hasnt been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3. Some workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual user on the host (such as with rootless containers that dont use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELi

{
  "guidelines_followed": true,
  "relevancy": "RELATED",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in runc's mount handling, specifically with os.MkdirAll. When sharing a volume between two containers, an attacker can manipulate symlinks to cause os.MkdirAll to create directories outside of the intended container rootfs, leading to empty directories or files on the host filesystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in mountpoint creation",
      "Insecure usage of os.MkdirAll, which can follow symlinks.",
      "Unsafe file creation using open(O_CREAT) instead of mknodat"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create empty files and directories in arbitrary locations on the host filesystem. While existing files are not truncated, this could lead to a denial of service (DoS) by creating directories in sensitive locations, such as configuration directories that daemons might not handle correctly, or by creating \"bad\" files like hung ttys. The impact is considered low due to the limited nature of the damage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Shared volume between two containers",
      "Manipulation of symlinks in the shared volume"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to start containers with custom volume configurations.  User namespaces reduce the scope, limiting creation to directories where the remapped root user/group has write access.  Strict LSM policies (SELinux/AppArmor) can further restrict the attack but aren't a complete mitigation by default."
  },
   "additional_notes": "The provided content includes the security advisory for CVE-2024-45310, patch commits, and related pull requests. These indicate that the vulnerability is fixed in runc versions 1.1.14 and 1.2.0-rc3. The patches introduce a more restricted MkdirAll function using file descriptors and mknodat to prevent symlink traversal and to avoid opening untrusted files. The advisory also notes the low severity (CVSS score of 3.6) and provides mitigation advice."
