  "description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attacks scope but the exact scope of protection hasnt been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3. Some workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual user on the host (such as with rootless containers that dont use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories.

The vulnerability is due to a **race condition** when sharing a volume between containers. |\n| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The **race condition** allows symlinks to be manipulated to create directories outside the intended container rootfs. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-362, which is a Class-level CWE. A more specific Base-level CWE could be considered, but CWE-362 directly reflects the **concurrent execution** and **improper synchronization** aspects of the **race condition**. CWE-59 is a Base-level CWE and is related because the **race condition** enables the \"Link Following\" issue. The graph below illustrates the relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    \n    cwe59 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) when sharing a volume between two containers. This **race condition** allows for the manipulation of symlinks, leading to CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access). The end result is the creation of empty files or directories in arbitrary locations on the host filesystem.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is a **race condition**, specifically CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')). The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **race condition** as the root cause, and the CVE reference links content summary further supports this by stating that the vulnerability stems from a **race condition** in runc's mount handling. The ability to manipulate symlinks due to the **race condition**, leading to the creation of files outside the intended container rootfs, suggests a secondary weakness, CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')).\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-362 as the primary weakness, with a high score and a recommendation to consider its Base-level children if applicable. While CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) **Race Condition**) is a Base-level CWE and also appears in the retriever results, CWE-362 is a better fit because it specifically addresses concurrent execution and shared resources, which are key aspects of this vulnerability. The evidence supports these findings and the chosen CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered but not selected because the issue is not directly related to incorrect permission assignments but rather to the **race condition** that allows symlink manipulation.\nCWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) was considered, but it is less relevant than CWE-59 because the core issue is with symlink following, not directly with pathname traversal.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
