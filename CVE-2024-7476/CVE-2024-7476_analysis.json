  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, this relates to CVE-2024-7476.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe code was updated to include project ID checks in SQL queries to prevent unauthorized access to data. The original code lacked these checks, potentially allowing users to access or modify data belonging to other projects.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Missing Access Control:** The original code did not properly enforce access control, allowing potential unauthorized access to data.\n*   **SQL Injection (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the use of string interpolation (`${}`) within SQL queries *could* be vulnerable to SQL injection if the input variables are not properly sanitized. However, the use of a SQL templating library (`sql``) suggests some level of protection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could potentially access data from projects they are not authorized to view.\n*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify data in projects they are not authorized to modify.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Exploiting the lack of project ID checks in the original code to access or modify data in other projects.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An authenticated user with the ability to make requests to the affected API endpoints.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The commit introduces project ID checks in SQL queries for the following endpoints:\n    *   `/datasets` (update)\n    *   `/external-users` (get, delete)\n    *   `/templates/:id/versions` (post)\n*   The code now includes `and project_id = ${projectId}` in the SQL queries to ensure that only data belonging to the current project is accessed or modified.\n*   Input validation using `zod` schema to ensure data integrity.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It shows the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability, including the exact SQL queries that were modified and the addition of project ID checks. It also shows the use of schema validation.",

However, based on the provided information, CWE-285 seems to capture the core issue. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is considered as a possible secondary CWE due to the nature of the vulnerability enabling a user to modify templates of other users.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **broken access control** (Improper Authorization), which allows an authenticated attacker to modify templates belonging to other users via a crafted HTTP POST request.

The key phrase \"**broken access control**\" and the description of the vulnerability allowing modification of other users' templates clearly indicate an authorization problem. The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the original code lacked proper access control and project ID checks, enabling unauthorized data access and modification.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as a strong candidate. While there are more specific CWEs, the available information doesn't pinpoint the precise mechanism of the authorization failure, making CWE-285 the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is also considered because the vulnerability involves modifying templates of other users, implying a bypass of authorization through a user-controlled key (the template ID). However, since the primary issue is the improper authorization check, CWE-285 is selected as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1766.27\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
