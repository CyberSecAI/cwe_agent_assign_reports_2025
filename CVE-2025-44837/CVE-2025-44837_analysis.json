The vulnerability description explicitly states that the TOTOLINK device is susceptible to **command injection** via a crafted request. The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the OS command, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe evidence is strong. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**command injection**\" and the impact is the ability to \"**execute arbitrary commands**\".\n\nCWE-77 was considered but not used because CWE-78 is a more specific case of command injection that directly applies to operating system commands. Other CWEs like SQL Injection or Cross-site Scripting were irrelevant given the context of OS command execution.\nThe chosen CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity as it clearly describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability.",
