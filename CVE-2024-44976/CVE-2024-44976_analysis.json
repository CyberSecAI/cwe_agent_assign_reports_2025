  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a DMA table overflow in the `pata_macio` driver within the Linux kernel, which is triggered by a commit that increased max_segment_size to 64KB. This matches the description of CVE-2024-44976.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- A previous commit (09fe2bfa6b83) increased the `max_segment_size` for the `pata_macio` driver to 64KB when the kernel's `PAGE_SIZE` is 64KB. The justification was that the SCSI core already used this size.\n- While the code includes logic to split oversized requests, this splitting results in each scatter-gather (sg) entry being converted into two DMA table entries.\n- With large requests, this splitting can lead to a DMA table overflow, triggering a kernel BUG_ON() and causing a crash.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **DMA table overflow:** The primary vulnerability is the overflow of the DMA table due to the request splitting logic interacting with increased max segment size.\n- **Incorrect `max_segment_size` handling:** The driver was incorrectly handling `max_segment_size`, particularly for 64KB page size kernels, without accounting for the table size limit.\n- **Insufficient DMA table size:**  The driver was not properly accounting for the number of DMA descriptors required when splitting larger requests, leading to the overflow.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Kernel crash:** Exploitation leads to a kernel panic or bug, resulting in a system crash.\n- **Denial of service:** The system becomes unusable due to the kernel crash.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Large I/O requests:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending large I/O requests to the affected storage device.\n- **Udev rule modification:** While not directly an attack vector, the vulnerability can be triggered if the `max_sectors_kb` setting of the device is increased, which is sometimes done through `udev` rules.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs the ability to make I/O requests to the device using the `pata_macio` driver.\n- The attacker may require knowledge about the block device configuration ( specifically related to `max_sectors_kb`).\n\n**Fix:**\n\nThe fix addresses the issue in the following ways:\n\n- **Reverts `max_segment_size` for 4KB kernels:** For kernels with a 4KB page size, the `max_segment_size` is reverted to the previous value (`MAX_DBDMA_SEG`).\n- **Halves `sg_tablesize` for 64KB kernels:** For 64KB page size kernels, the `sg_tablesize` is halved (`MAX_DCMDS / 2`), which makes space in the DMA table by allowing for the possibility of each sg entry being split into two DMA commands. This ensures the table doesn't overflow when the request is split.\n\nThis commit (822c8020aebcf5804a143b891e34f29873fee5e2 and 709e4c8f78e156ab332297bdd87527ec3da4e2d4) effectively fixes the DMA table overflow vulnerability in the `pata_macio` driver and prevents system crashes on affected systems.",
