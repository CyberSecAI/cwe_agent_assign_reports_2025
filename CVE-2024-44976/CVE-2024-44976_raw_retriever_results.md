## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ata pata_macio Fix DMA table overflow Kolbjrn and Jonas reported that their 32-bit PowerMacs were crashing in pata-macio since commit 09fe2bfa6b83 (ata pata_macio Fix max_segment_size with PAGE_SIZE == 64K). For example kernel BUG at drivers/ata/pata_macio.c544! Oops Exception in kernel mode, sig 5 [#1] BE PAGE_SIZE=4K MMU=Hash SMP NR_CPUS=2 DEBUG_PAGEALLOC PowerMac ...

However with a sufficiently large request, the splitting logic causes each sg to be split into two commands in the DMA table, leading to overflow of the DMA table, triggering the BUG_ON().
