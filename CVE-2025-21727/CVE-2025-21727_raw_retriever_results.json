This can be explained as bellow pcrypt_aead_encrypt ... padata_do_parallel refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt) // add refcnt ... padata_do_serial padata_reorder // pd while (1) { padata_find_next(pd, true) // using pd queue_work_on ... padata_serial_worker crypto_del_alg padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt padata_free_shell padata_put_pd(ps->pd) // pd is freed // loop again, but pd is freed // call padata_find_next, UAF } In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in while, if the alg is deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering padata_find_next, which leads to UAF. As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add synchronize_rcu() in padata_free_shell wait for all _do_serial calls to finish.
