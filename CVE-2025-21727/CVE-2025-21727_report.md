# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21727

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved padata fix **UAF** in padata_reorder A bug was found when run ltp test BUG KASAN slab-**use-after-free** in padata_find_next+0x29/0x1a0 Read of size 4 at addr ffff88bbfe003524 by task kworker/u1132/3039206 CPU 0 PID 3039206 Comm kworker/u1132 Kdump loaded Not tainted 6.6.0+ Workqueue pdecrypt_parallel padata_parallel_worker Call Trace dump_stack_lvl+0x32/0x50 print_address_description.constprop.0+0x6b/0x3d0 print_report+0xdd/0x2c0 kasan_report+0xa5/0xd0 padata_find_next+0x29/0x1a0 padata_reorder+0x131/0x220 padata_parallel_worker+0x3d/0xc0 process_one_work+0x2ec/0x5a0 If mdelay(10) is added before calling padata_find_next in the padata_reorder function, this issue could be reproduced easily with ltp test (pcrypt_aead01). This can be explained as bellow pcrypt_aead_encrypt ... padata_do_parallel refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt) // add refcnt ... padata_do_serial padata_reorder // pd while (1) { padata_find_next(pd, true) // using pd queue_work_on ... padata_serial_worker crypto_del_alg padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt padata_free_shell padata_put_pd(ps->pd) // pd is freed // loop again, but pd is freed // call padata_find_next, **UAF** } In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in while, if the alg is deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering padata_find_next, which leads to **UAF**. As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add synchronize_rcu() in padata_free_shell wait for all _do_serial calls to finish.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-416 **Use After Free** is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. CWE-362 **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')** is a class-level CWE, suggesting a broader category of concurrency issues that may contribute to the vulnerability. The vulnerability description suggests a race condition enables the use-after-free.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a potential race condition (CWE-362) due to concurrent access to shared resources. This leads to a situation where a resource is freed while still being referenced, resulting in a **use-after-free** vulnerability (CWE-416).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identifies CWE-416 **Use After Free** as the primary weakness, directly matching the vulnerability description's key phrases: "**UAF**" and "**use-after-free**". The description also suggests a race condition preceding the **UAF**, indicating a concurrency issue and suggesting CWE-362 **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')** as a secondary contributing factor. The relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-416 as the primary CWE due to its specific nature and CWE-362 as a contributing factor. The evidence from the vulnerability description clearly points to a **use-after-free** scenario, making CWE-416 the most appropriate choice.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
