  "query": "Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability. Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro is executed. Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.2 before 24.2.5.",
