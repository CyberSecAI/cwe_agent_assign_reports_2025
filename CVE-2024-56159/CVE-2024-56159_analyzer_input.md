# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56159

## Vulnerability Description
Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. A bug in the build process allows any unauthenticated user to read parts of the server source code. During build, along with client assets such as css and font files, the sourcemap files **for the server code** are moved to a publicly-accessible folder. Any outside party can read them with an unauthorized HTTP GET request to the same server hosting the rest of the website. While some server files are hashed, making their access obscure, the files corresponding to the file system router (those in `src/pages`) are predictably named. For example. the sourcemap file for `src/pages/index.astro` gets named `dist/client/pages/index.astro.mjs.map`. This vulnerability is the root cause of issue #12703, which links to a simple stackblitz project demonstrating the vulnerability. Upon build, notice the contents of the `dist/client` (referred to as `config.build.client` in astro code) folder. All astro servers make the folder in question accessible to the public internet without any authentication. It contains `.map` files corresponding to the code that runs on the server. All **server-output** projects on Astro 5 versions **v5.0.3** through **v5.0.7**, that have **sourcemaps enabled**, either directly or through an add-on such as `sentry`, are affected. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**. Additionally, all **static-output** projects built using Astro 4 versions **4.16.17 or older**, or Astro 5 versions **5.0.8 or older**, that have **sourcemaps enabled** are also affected. The fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9**, and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. The immediate impact is limited to source code. Any secrets or environment variables are not exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code. There is no immediate loss of integrity within the the vulnerable server. However, it is possible to subsequently discover another vulnerability via the revealed source code . There is no immediate impact to availability of the vulnerable server. However, the presence of an unsafe regular expression, for example, can quickly be exploited to subsequently compromise the availability. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**, and the fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9** and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. Users are advised to update immediately if they are using sourcemaps or an integration that enables sourcemaps.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-56159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the build process of the Astro framework, where sourcemap files for server-side code are unintentionally moved to a publicly accessible directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Public Exposure of Sourcemaps:** The core weakness is that the build process places server-side sourcemap files in a location accessible to any unauthenticated user.
- **Predictable File Names:** While some server files are hashed, files associated with the file system router (typically located in `src/pages`) have predictable names, making them easier to locate and access.
- **Insecure Asset Handling:** The `ssrMoveAssets` function in `static-build.ts` is responsible for moving these assets, but it incorrectly places server-side sourcemaps in the public directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Source Code Disclosure:** Attackers can reconstruct the server-side source code by accessing the exposed `.map` files and using tools like `source-map-visualization`. This allows an attacker to see the application's logic and implementation details.
- **Potential for Further Vulnerability Discovery:** The revealed source code can be analyzed to identify other vulnerabilities, such as insecure regular expressions or logic flaws, that can then be exploited.
- **Limited direct Exposure:** Secrets and environment variables are not directly exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code itself.
- **Potential Availability Issues:** While there's no immediate impact on availability, the discovery of vulnerabilities via source code can lead to availability issues, such as exploiting an unsafe regular expression.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send an HTTP GET request to retrieve the sourcemap files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or authorization to access the files.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker does not need any interaction from the legitimate users of the website.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attacker only needs to send an HTTP request, and the location of files are relatively easy to guess.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:**
    - Astro 5 versions `v5.0.3` through `v5.0.6` (inclusive) for server-output projects, and `5.0.7` or older for static-output projects.
    - Astro 4 versions `4.16.17` or older for static-output projects.
- **Patched Versions:**
    - Astro `5.0.7` fixes the issue for server-output projects.
    - Astro `5.0.8` and `4.16.18` (backported) fixes for static-output projects.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves preventing the sourcemap files from being moved to the publicly accessible folder.
- **Sentry Integration:** The Sentry integration for Astro can enable sourcemaps, which could expose the vulnerability if not correctly configured or if the Astro version is vulnerable.

**CVSS Metrics:**

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
