- **product:** fast-xml-parser
- **version:** prior to 4.4.1
- **component:** currency.js

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41818:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `github.com_bbe5c4a6_20250111_045200.html` directly references **GHSA-mpg4-rc92-vx8v**, which is associated with CVE-2024-41818. This confirms that the provided content is indeed related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (regex) used in the `currency.js` file of the `fast-xml-parser` library's experimental v5.
*   The vulnerable regex is: `^\s\*(?:-|\+)?(?:\d+|\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+)?(?:\.\d{1,2})?\s\*(?:\$|€|¥|₹)?\s\*$/u`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The regex used for currency parsing is susceptible to ReDoS attacks.
*   The regex has the potential to cause catastrophic backtracking when processing a specially crafted string

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a malicious string, an attacker can cause the server to expend excessive resources attempting to parse the input, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   The parsing process becomes extremely slow, effectively blocking the parsing functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** An attacker can send malicious XML data containing a crafted string to be parsed by the vulnerable library.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specifically crafted string to the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable regex is located in `src/v5/valueParsers/currency.js` at line 10.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) string is: `'\t'.repeat(13337) + '.'`.
* The vulnerability is present in version v4.2.4 of the library and was fixed in v4.4.1

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided information includes the CVSS v3 base metrics, highlighting the high severity of the vulnerability due to its potential to cause a denial of service.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerable regular expression in currency parsing.
*   **Weakness:** ReDoS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No privileges needed, no user interaction required.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** `src/v5/valueParsers/currency.js`
*   **PoC:** `'\t'.repeat(13337) + '.'`
*   **Affected Version:** v4.2.4
*   **Patched Version:** v4.4.1
