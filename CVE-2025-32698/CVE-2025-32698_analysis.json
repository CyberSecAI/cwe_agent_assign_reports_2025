It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its root cause, and the fix.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect condition in `LogPager.php` within the `enforceActionRestrictions()` and `enforcePerformerRestrictions()` functions. Specifically, the code incorrectly compares the result of a bitwise AND operation against `LogPage::SUPPRESSED_USER` instead of `LogPage::SUPPRESSED_ACTION` (and vice versa in the other function). This allows users with `deletedhistory` rights (but *not* suppression rights) to view suppressed log entries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Access Control:**  The flawed logic in the restriction enforcement functions allows unauthorized access to suppressed log data.\n*   **Logic Error:** A simple comparison error in the bitwise AND operation leads to the vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nExploitation allows users with `deletedhistory` rights to view suppressed usernames or page titles in log entries, revealing information that should be hidden from them. While not a severe issue in practice (requiring knowledge or brute-forcing of suppressed data), it represents an information leak.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker with `deletedhistory` rights can navigate to Special:Log and view suppressed log entries.\n*   The attacker needs to know or guess a suppressed username or page title to confirm the leak.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker must have a user account with `deletedhistory` rights within the MediaWiki installation.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe fix involves swapping `LogPage::SUPPRESSED_USER` and `LogPage::SUPPRESSED_ACTION` in the incorrect comparison within the `enforceActionRestrictions()` and `enforcePerformerRestrictions()` functions of `LogPager.php`.  The patch is available as:\n\n*   [F58387290: 0001-SECURITY-Fix-log-entry-search-revealing-suppressed-d.patch](https://phab.wmfusercontent.org/file/download/b3c5o5ndb6rglq6jev6j/PHID-FILE-3k6t3aunnxwps47ufx4g/0001-SECURITY-Fix-log-entry-search-revealing-suppressed-d.patch)\n\nThe patch has been merged into the following branches:\n\n*   `master`\n*   `REL1_39`\n*   `REL1_42`\n*   `REL1_43`\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The issue was introduced in commit [60aa90500668](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/60aa90500668) and related to a previous security fix (T188145).\n*   The vulnerability affects MediaWiki versions since 1.31.\n*   The fix has been deployed as of February 24, 2025.\n*   The task was made public on April 21, 2025, following the security release announcement.",

The vulnerability involves unauthorized access to suppressed log data due to a flawed authorization check. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a high-level class that describes the impact of the vulnerability. There isn't a clear chain relationship, but CWE-863 can lead to CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863) in the `enforceActionRestrictions()` and `enforcePerformerRestrictions()` functions due to a logic error. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to users with `deletedhistory` rights but without suppression rights.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect authorization** check. The evidence from the CVE reference link clearly states that the vulnerability stems from an incorrect condition in `LogPager.php` within the `enforceActionRestrictions()` and `enforcePerformerRestrictions()` functions, where the code incorrectly compares the result of a bitwise AND operation. This allows users with `deletedhistory` rights (but *not* suppression rights) to view suppressed log entries.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). While the vulnerability does lead to the exposure of sensitive information, the root cause is the **incorrect authorization**. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-200 is a suitable secondary CWE as it represents the impact of the vulnerability, but it's a more general classification. It's important to note that the usage of CWE-200 is discouraged as a root cause error according to MITRE guidelines.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a class-level CWE that accurately captures the nature of the authorization flaw. The evidence strongly supports the classification of the primary CWE as **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
