# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9262

## Description

The User Meta User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via the getUser() due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** ['Insecure Direct Object Reference', 'missing validation on a user controlled key']
- **Weakness:** insecure direct object reference
- **Impact:** obtain user meta values from form fields
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely
- **Product:** User Meta User Profile Builder and User management plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 3.1
- **Component:** getUser()

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a Base level CWE, indicating a specific type of authorization bypass. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE that represents a broader category of missing authorization, and is a parent of CWE-425 "Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')". The vulnerability involves **missing validation** which allows bypassing authorization. This is best captured by CWE-639.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing validation on a user controlled key** (CWE-639), which leads to an **insecure direct object reference**. This then leads to the impact of being able to **obtain user meta values from form fields**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **missing validation on a user controlled key** which allows an attacker to directly access user data. The vulnerability description states that there is **missing validation on a user controlled key** in the `getUser()` function. This allows an authenticated attacker to obtain user meta values. The most relevant CWE is CWE-639, as it directly addresses authorization bypass through user-controlled keys. The description matches the CWE as the system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

CWE-862 was considered, but it is a broader category of missing authorization. Since the vulnerability specifies that the authorization bypass is due to a user-controlled key, CWE-639 is a more precise and appropriate mapping.

Relevant Evidence:
*   "**missing validation on a user controlled key**"
*   "**Insecure Direct Object Reference**"
*   "obtain user meta values from form fields"
*   "getUser() due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**"
*   "This makes it possible for authenticated attackers... to obtain user meta values from form fields."

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
