# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45169

# Vulnerability Description

    An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Due to **improper input validation**, **improper **deserialization****, **and improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer**, IDOL2 is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and possibly remote code execution via the \xB0\x00\x3c byte sequence.
