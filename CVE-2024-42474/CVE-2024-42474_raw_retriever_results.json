  "query": "Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Snowflake Streamlit open source addressed a security vulnerability via the static file sharing feature. Users of hosted Streamlit app(s) on Windows were vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability when the static file sharing feature is enabled. An attacker could utilize the vulnerability to leak the password hash of the Windows user running Streamlit. The vulnerability was patched on Jul 25, 2024, as part of Streamlit open source version 1.37.0. The vulnerability only affects Windows.",
