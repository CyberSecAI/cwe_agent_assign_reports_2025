## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in gongfuxiang schoolcms 2.3.1. This affects the function SaveInfo of the file /index.php?m=Admin&c=article&a=SaveInfo. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** gongfuxiang schoolcms
- **version:** 2.3.1
- **component:** /index.php?m=Admin&c=article&a=SaveInfo

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

Both provided content snippets are identical and detail a SQL injection vulnerability in SchoolCMS v2.3.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a historical SQL injection flaw within the ThinkPHP 3.2.3 framework. Specifically, the `find()`, `select()`, and `delete()` functions are susceptible if they contain controllable variables. The `id` variable in this case is identified as controllable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.
*   Use of vulnerable framework: Utilizing an older version of ThinkPHP (3.2.3) with known vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:

*   Read sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify data in the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server (depending on database permissions and configuration).

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the `id` parameter in a GET request to the `SaveInfo` action of the `ArticleController`. The provided PoC demonstrates using a `sleep(6)` payload to confirm the injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the PoC shows accessing the vulnerable endpoint without login.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but the following mitigations are implied:

*   Upgrade to a newer, patched version of the ThinkPHP framework.
*   Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit and step-by-step instructions for reproducing the vulnerability.
