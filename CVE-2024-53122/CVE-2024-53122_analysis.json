  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust Additional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path manager - are included into the subflow list before starting the 3whs. A racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established subflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the current subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on the newly created ones. Explicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before invoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nA race condition exists in the `mptcp_rcv_space_adjust` function when new subflows are created in the kernel path manager. Specifically, a `recvmsg()` call on an established subflow can race with the creation of a new subflow.\n\n**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**\n- **Race Condition:** The core issue is the race between `recvmsg()` and subflow creation. When `recvmsg()` is called, it unconditionally calls `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()` on *all* current subflows.\n- **Uninitialized Subflow:** Newly created subflows might not be fully initialized when `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()` is called on them.\n- **Divide-by-Zero:** The `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()` function, when called on uninitialized subflows, can lead to a divide-by-zero error.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Kernel Crash:** The divide-by-zero error will likely cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network Traffic:** An attacker can trigger the race condition by sending network traffic that creates new subflows while simultaneously attempting to receive data on existing subflows.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send and receive network traffic on an MPTCP connection. They must be able to cause new subflows to be created and trigger a `recvmsg()` operation simultaneously.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability lies in `net/mptcp/protocol.c` within the `mptcp_rcv_space_adjust` function.\n- The fix involves checking if the subflow is in a suitable state using `tcp_can_send_ack(ssk)` before calling `tcp_cleanup_rbuf(ssk, 1)`.\n- The fix commit is ce7356ae35943cc6494cc692e62d51a734062b7d. This commit is referenced in other commits in the provided content.\n- The issue was introduced by commit c76c6956566f (\"mptcp: call tcp_cleanup_rbuf on subflows\").\n\n**Summary:** The vulnerability is a race condition that leads to a potential divide-by-zero error in the Linux kernel's MPTCP implementation, triggered by racing subflow creation with receiving data, leading to a kernel panic. The fix is to verify the state of the subflow before calling `tcp_cleanup_rbuf`.",

However, no base CWE sufficiently fits the vulnerability. The vulnerability involves a **race condition** where concurrent access to a shared resource (the subflow list) leads to a divide-by-zero error. While CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) was considered, the vulnerability doesn't strictly fit the TOCTOU pattern as the issue is not about checking a resource's state before use, but rather concurrent modification of a shared resource.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe421[\"CWE-421: Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe421 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n    \n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** in `mptcp_rcv_space_adjust` when new subflows are created concurrently with `recvmsg()` calls. This leads to `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()` being called on an uninitialized subflow, resulting in a divide-by-zero error.\n\nRace Condition -> Call on Uninitialized Subflow -> Divide-by-Zero Error\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, as the vulnerability involves a **race condition** due to concurrent execution using shared resources. The evidence clearly points to a timing issue in the `mptcp_rcv_space_adjust` function where subflow creation races with `recvmsg()` calls.\n\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which explicitly mentions the **race condition** and the potential for a divide-by-zero error when `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()` is called on uninitialized subflows. The fix, which involves checking the state of the subflow before invoking `tcp_cleanup_rbuf()`, further supports the **race condition** assessment.\n\nWhile several other CWEs were considered, such as CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking), they did not accurately represent the core issue. CWE-362 is at the appropriate level of specificity, capturing the essence of the **race condition** without being overly specific about the type of race or the resources involved. The resulting divide by zero error could also be classified as CWE-476, a NULL Pointer Dereference, because the uninitialized subflow is essentially a null pointer. This is a secondary effect of the **race condition**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
