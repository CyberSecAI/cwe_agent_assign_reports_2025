# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23147

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i3c Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi() The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not been probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue an IBI work task, leading to Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory and resulting in a kernel panic. Typical IBI handling flow 1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers. 2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`. 3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device drivers IBI handler task. However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe sequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`, leading to a kernel panic. Add a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing an uninitialized `dev->ibi`, ensuring stability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition where the I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not been probed yet**
