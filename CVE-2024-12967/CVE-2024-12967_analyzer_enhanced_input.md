## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. Affected is the function fln_update of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php. The manipulation of the argument fname/lname leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1
- **component:** function fln_update in /_parse/_all_edits.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability within the `job-recruitment-in-php` application. Specifically, the `fname` parameter, when used in the `fln_update` action, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because user-supplied input (`fname` parameter) is directly inserted into the SQL query string.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the input received through the `fname` parameter.
- **Direct Query Execution:** The application executes the constructed SQL query without using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code. This could include usernames, passwords, personal information, or any other data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Depending on the database setup, a successful SQL injection attack might even enable an attacker to gain access to system-level functions and potentially take over the database server.
- In the provided example, the attacker can obtain the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/_parse/_all_edits.php` endpoint.
- **`fname` Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `fname` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- **Understanding of the application's input parameters:** The attacker needs to know the existence and function of the `fname` parameter and its usage.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection Techniques:** The attacker should possess knowledge of SQL injection syntax and techniques to craft effective attacks.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

- The vulnerable application is a "job-recruitment-in-php" system.
- The specific file where the vulnerability exists is in the `fln_update` action.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) is given, demonstrating how to retrieve the database name through SQL injection using the `fname` parameter.
- A link to the vulnerable software is provided.
