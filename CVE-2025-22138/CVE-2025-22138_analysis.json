  "description": "@codidact/qpixel is a Q&A-based community knowledge-sharing software. In affected versions when a category is set to private or limited-visibility within QPixels admin tools, suggested edits within this category can still be viewed by unprivileged or anonymous users via the suggested edit queue. This issue has not yet been patched and no workarounds are available. Users are advised to follow the development repo for updates. ### Patches Not yet patched. ### Workarounds None available. Private or limited-visibility categories should not be considered ways to store sensitive information. ### References Internal [SUPPORT-114](https//codidact.atlassian.net/issues/SUPPORT-114)",

The secondary relationship is that CWE-863 is also a Class-level CWE and describes the **incorrect authorization** mechanism that leads to the information exposure. Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it is chosen here because the description focuses on the information exposure more than the underlying **authorization bypass**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|PeerOf| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization**, where private or limited-visibility categories are not properly protected. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information in suggested edits to unprivileged or anonymous users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary highlighted the unauthorized access to suggested edits as the main issue. This pointed towards CWE-200 as a potential candidate. However, the retriever results suggested CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, as a possible alternative. Although CWE-200 is discouraged because it describes the impact, the vulnerability description emphasizes the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. Therefore, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE to highlight the confidentiality breach, and CWE-863 is selected as a secondary CWE due to the underlying **authorization** issue. The evidence is based on the vulnerability description, which states that \"suggested edits within this category can still be viewed by unprivileged or anonymous users.\" This demonstrates that **authorization** is not being correctly enforced.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
