This can lead to **multiple security issues** including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are /v1/share/{idstr} for uploading and /v1/share/{idstr} for downloading JSON files. The **lack of authentication** allows any user to upload and overwrite files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts, and accessing sensitive information.',

This can lead to **multiple security issues** including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are /v1/share/{idstr} for uploading and /v1/share/{idstr} for downloading JSON files.
