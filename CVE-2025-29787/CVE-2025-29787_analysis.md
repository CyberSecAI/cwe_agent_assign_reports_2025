# Analysis for CVE-2025-29787

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves the use of symbolic links to overwrite arbitrary files. |
| CWE-23 | Relative Path Traversal | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Although not explicitly stated, the symbolic link can resolve to a location outside the restricted directory. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). The description explicitly states that symbolic links are used to overwrite arbitrary files. CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal is related, as the symbolic link can resolve to a location outside the intended directory, but this is not as direct a match as CWE-59.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves a malicious zip archive containing symbolic links. The **weakness** is that these symbolic links are not validated, allowing them to point to arbitrary files. When the archive is extracted, these links are used to **overwrite arbitrary files**, leading to potential code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the use of symbolic links to overwrite files. The key phrase is "**symbolic link overwrite**". The CVE description states: "symbolic links earlier in the archive are allowed to be used for later files in the archive without validation of the final canonicalized path." This directly aligns with CWE-59, which describes the improper resolution of links before file access.

CWE-23 is a potential secondary weakness, as the symbolic links may resolve to locations outside the intended directory. The retriever results also suggest CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), however CWE-23 is more appropriate because of the Relative path traversal via the link.

The selected CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing a precise representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
