**CVE Description:** Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) 5.0 Appliance - SRS, version(s) 5.26, Enables Live-Restore setting which enhances security by keeping containers running during daemon restarts, reducing attack exposure, preventing accidental misconfigurations, and ensuring security controls remain active.

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The content does not describe a vulnerability being *fixed* by enabling the Live-Restore setting. Instead, it states that enabling this setting *enhances security* by mitigating potential issues during daemon restarts. It's a preventative measure rather than a fix for a specific flaw.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The content doesn't explicitly state any pre-existing vulnerabilities. It implies that daemon restarts could potentially lead to attack exposure or misconfigurations, but doesn't detail the specific weaknesses.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is described as reduced attack exposure, prevention of accidental misconfigurations, and ensuring security controls remain active.  Without a specific vulnerability described, the impact is framed as preventing potential negative outcomes.

**4. Attack vectors:**
Not specified. The content doesn't detail how an attacker might exploit a system without the Live-Restore setting enabled.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Not specified.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**
Enable the Live-Restore setting in Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) 5.0 Appliance - SRS, version(s) 5.26 or later. Update to version 5.28.00.14 or later.
