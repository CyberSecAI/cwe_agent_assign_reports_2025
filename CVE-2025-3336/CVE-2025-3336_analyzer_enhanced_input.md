## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3336 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a potential CVE, not the official CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/admin/member_save.php` file of the 'Restaurant Management System' project.
*   The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'last' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   Comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `last` parameter in a POST request to `/admin/member_save.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Restaurant Management System Project in PHP with Source Code
*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/>
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/member_save.php`
*   **Version:** V1.0
*   **Software Link:** <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip>
*   **Payload Examples:** The report includes several SQLmap payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks targeting the `last` parameter.
*   **POC:** A screenshot of SQLmap output is provided, demonstrating database enumeration.
