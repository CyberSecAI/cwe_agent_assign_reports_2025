# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-32890

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-353 | Missing Support for Integrity Check | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability lies in the lack of integrity checks on the encrypted data, which allows an attacker to modify the messages. |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The description indicates a "custom implementation of encryption," which may imply the use of a weak or flawed algorithm. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the ChildOf relationship.
- CWE-353 (Missing Support for Integrity Check) is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity).
- CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a Class level CWE and might have more appropriate Base-level children.
- The analysis focuses on the **missing** integrity check as the root cause, making CWE-353 the more direct and appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of integrity checking** in the custom encryption implementation, leading to the ability for attackers to modify messages.
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing support for integrity check** (CWE-353)
2.  **Impact:** Malleable messages, allowing for unauthorized modification.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-353, was chosen because the vulnerability description explicitly states the **lack of integrity checking mechanisms**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-353. The description states "It uses a **custom implementation of encryption without any additional integrity checking mechanisms**. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message."

CWE-327 was considered as a secondary factor, as the **custom implementation** might involve a broken or risky algorithm. However, the primary issue and the explicitly stated weakness is the missing integrity check, making CWE-353 the more accurate representation of the root cause.

The retriever results also support this decision. CWE-353 wasn't directly listed in the top results, but the similar CWE-649 (Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking) was, which suggests the importance of integrity checking in this context. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also listed CWE-353 as a weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-353 being a Base level CWE and directly addressing the **missing** integrity check.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
