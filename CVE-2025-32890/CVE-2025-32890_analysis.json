It uses a custom implementation of encryption without any additional integrity checking mechanisms, leaving messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message.\n\n**Root Cause:** Custom encryption implementation lacking integrity checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   Missing Support for Integrity Check (CWE-353)\n*   Weak encryption\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:** Messages can be modified by an attacker who has access to them.\n\n**Attack Vectors:** Access to the message. (CVSS Score 5.3 - CVSS:3.1/AC:H/AV:A/A:N/C:N/I:H/PR:N/S:U/UI:N)\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Access to the message.\n\n**Mitigation/Fix:** The vendor discontinued support for goTenna v1 and Mesh devices, implying no official fix is available.  The content references a fix for similar vulnerabilities in the goTenna Pro, but this does not apply to the affected devices.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Products:** goTenna Mesh - goTenna App version 5.5.3, goTenna Mesh firmware version 1.1.12\n*   **Discoverers:** Clayton Smith, Erwin Karincic\n*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported in 2017 and 2018.\n*   The vendor discontinued the civilian market for these devices in 2024.\n*   The issue is related to similar vulnerabilities found in goTenna Pro, which were addressed in ICS advisory ICSA-24-270-04.",

This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-353. The description states \"It uses a **custom implementation of encryption without any additional integrity checking mechanisms**. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message.\"\n\nCWE-327 was considered as a secondary factor, as the **custom implementation** might involve a broken or risky algorithm. However, the primary issue and the explicitly stated weakness is the missing integrity check, making CWE-353 the more accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results also support this decision. CWE-353 wasn't directly listed in the top results, but the similar CWE-649 (Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking) was, which suggests the importance of integrity checking in this context. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also listed CWE-353 as a weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-353 being a Base level CWE and directly addressing the **missing** integrity check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
