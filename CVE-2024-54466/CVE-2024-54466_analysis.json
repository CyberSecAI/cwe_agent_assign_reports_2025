The vulnerability allows an encrypted volume to be accessed by a different user without the proper password authentication.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn unauthorized user can gain access to an encrypted volume without being prompted for the password, potentially exposing sensitive data stored on the volume.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves a local user attempting to access an encrypted volume that is intended for another user.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be a user on the same system as the user who owns the encrypted volume.\n\n**Affected Products:**\nmacOS Sonoma 14.7.2, macOS Ventura 13.7.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2.",

While it's generally discouraged to use Class-level CWEs, the provided information doesn't point to a more specific Base or Variant CWE. The analysis considered relationships such as ChildOf, ParentOf, and PeerOf, but none provided a clearer or more accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available details.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe285 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authorization issue** (CWE-285) leading to the impact of an encrypted volume being accessed without a password prompt.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis heavily relies on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which explicitly states that the root cause is an **authorization issue** in DiskArbitration. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlight the **authorization issue** as the root cause.\n\nThe choice of CWE-285 is at the appropriate level of specificity given the available information. While CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, there isn't enough information to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant CWE. The guidance suggests considering CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) if more details were available. However, the description only mentions an **authorization issue** without specifying whether the authorization was missing or incorrect. Therefore, CWE-285 is the most suitable choice, even though it's a Class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE does not match the vulnerability description of an **authorization issue.**\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE does not match the vulnerability description of an **authorization issue.**\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
