## Vulnerability Description
Libxmp through 4.6.2 has a **stack-based buffer overflow** in depack_pha in loaders/prowizard/pha.c via a malformed Pha format tracker module in a .mod file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** malformed Pha format tracker module
- **product:** Libxmp
- **version:** through 4.6.2
- **component:** depack_pha in loaders/prowizard/pha.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-47256.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `depack_pha()` function of libxmp. This occurs due to improper bounds checking when parsing malformed Pha Packer (PHA) module files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) under specific build or runtime conditions.
*   **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious .mod or .pha file in Pha Packer format and feeding it to applications linked with libxmp.
*   **Affected component:** `src/loaders/prowizard/pha.c`
*   **Function:** `depack_pha()`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted .mod or .pha file to an application that uses libxmp.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not provided in the content.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides the affected function, build instructions, and a PoC.
