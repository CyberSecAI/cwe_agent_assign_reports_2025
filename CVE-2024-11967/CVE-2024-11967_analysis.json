  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11967 (based on the provided github issue)\n\n**Root Cause:**\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the 'email' parameter in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file. The application directly uses the user-supplied 'email' parameter in SQL queries without sanitizing or validating it.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Malicious SQL code can be injected through the 'email' parameter, which is then executed by the database.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Confidential data stored in the database can be exposed.\n*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n*   **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers can achieve control over the entire system.\n*  **Service Disruption:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by modifying critical database entries or causing the system to malfunction.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/reset-password.php` file, specifically targeting the 'email' parameter in the request body.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the 'email' parameter in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n**Technical Details**\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file of the \"Complaint Management system\" version 1.0.\n*   The application uses the 'email' parameter unsanitized in SQL queries.\n*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.\n*   SQLmap tool is used to demonstrate the exploitation.\n\n**Mitigation**\n*   The content suggests the following remediation measures:\n    1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  To separate SQL code from user-provided input data.\n    2.  **Input validation and filtering:** To ensure user inputs conform to expected formats.\n    3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** To limit potential damage in case of exploitation.\n    4.  **Regular security audits:** To proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis detailed analysis provides more comprehensive information about the vulnerability than the typical, short CVE description.",
