## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- The vulnerability is a remote buffer overflow in the SharkSSL TLS client hello handshake implementation. The vulnerability is located in the TLSv1.2 server-site handshake implementation. Specifically, the function `handleptrauth` parses TLS Extensions of a received Client Hello message. The Extension Length field of the TLS Client Hello message is provided in the unsigned 16-bit integer variable `len`. An attacker can manipulate the value of this variable.
- Within the function, there is a loop with condition `len > 2` that decrements the variable `len` multiple times in each iteration. The pointer `registeredevent` points to the Client Hello message and is incremented and de-referenced in each iteration. The loop subtracts small values from `len` repeatedly, which can lead to an integer wrap-around and a high value for `len`. This, combined with the loop condition and the iterative increment of `registeredevent`, leads to a buffer overflow.
- A variant of this vulnerability allows controlled manipulation of the pointer `registeredevent` by a variable named `paramnamed`, which is an unsigned 16-bit integer value read from the TLS Extensions section, and is therefore attacker-controlled. This allows for additional incrementations of `registeredevent`, leading to the potential for a controlled manipulation of the pointer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote buffer overflow
- Integer wrap-around
- Memory access errors

Impact of exploitation:
- Allows an attacker to read large regions of the SharkSSL TLS server's memory.
- Likely to result in a segmentation fault.
- Can be used for a remote Denial-of-Service attack.
- Potentially allows for information leak.
- Potentially allows for remote code execution.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a malformed TLS Client Hello message to the SharkSSL TLS server.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted TLS Client Hello message to the SharkSSL TLS server.

Mitigation or fix:
- The vulnerability was patched on 07th Sep 2024 (commit hash: c585490e9567733095d3134eadc054bcc7cec34e)
