  },
  "reference_content": "```\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\n- The vulnerability is a remote buffer overflow in the SharkSSL TLS client hello handshake implementation. The vulnerability is located in the TLSv1.2 server-site handshake implementation. Specifically, the function `handleptrauth` parses TLS Extensions of a received Client Hello message. The Extension Length field of the TLS Client Hello message is provided in the unsigned 16-bit integer variable `len`. An attacker can manipulate the value of this variable.\n- Within the function, there is a loop with condition `len > 2` that decrements the variable `len` multiple times in each iteration. The pointer `registeredevent` points to the Client Hello message and is incremented and de-referenced in each iteration. The loop subtracts small values from `len` repeatedly, which can lead to an integer wrap-around and a high value for `len`. This, combined with the loop condition and the iterative increment of `registeredevent`, leads to a buffer overflow.\n- A variant of this vulnerability allows controlled manipulation of the pointer `registeredevent` by a variable named `paramnamed`, which is an unsigned 16-bit integer value read from the TLS Extensions section, and is therefore attacker-controlled. This allows for additional incrementations of `registeredevent`, leading to the potential for a controlled manipulation of the pointer.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Remote buffer overflow\n- Integer wrap-around\n- Memory access errors\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Allows an attacker to read large regions of the SharkSSL TLS server's memory.\n- Likely to result in a segmentation fault.\n- Can be used for a remote Denial-of-Service attack.\n- Potentially allows for information leak.\n- Potentially allows for remote code execution.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Sending a malformed TLS Client Hello message to the SharkSSL TLS server.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted TLS Client Hello message to the SharkSSL TLS server.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- The vulnerability was patched on 07th Sep 2024 (commit hash: c585490e9567733095d3134eadc054bcc7cec34e)\n```",

Additionally, CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) can precede CWE-119, which aligns with the vulnerability description indicating an integer wraparound leading to a buffer overflow. Choosing CWE-190 as the root cause and CWE-122 as the result of that overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, which occurs due to the manipulation of the `len` variable in the loop condition. This leads to a high value for `len`, and subsequently results in **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow** due to the iterative increment of `registeredevent` beyond the allocated buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified both integer overflow and heap buffer overflow. The evidence clearly shows that the integer overflow is the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"The loop subtracts small values from `len` repeatedly, which can lead to an integer wrap-around and a high value for `len`. This, combined with the loop condition and the iterative increment of `registeredevent`, leads to a buffer overflow.\" This confirms that the integer overflow precedes and causes the heap buffer overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-190 and CWE-122 is based on the detailed analysis of the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence. The relationship analysis further solidifies this mapping, as CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, the parent of CWE-122. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-190 being a Base CWE and CWE-122 being a Variant CWE.\n\n**CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability involves an integer wraparound in the `len` variable, which is used to control a loop that increments a pointer. By manipulating the input, an attacker can cause `len` to wrap around to a large value, leading to excessive pointer increments and a buffer overflow.\n*   **Security Implications:** An integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, which can result in denial of service, information leakage, or remote code execution.\n*   **Relationship to Other CWEs:** CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), as the overflow leads to out-of-bounds memory access.\n*   **Primary/Secondary:** Primary CWE\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The official MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-190 and it aligns with the described vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow because the `registeredevent` pointer is incremented beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, resulting in memory corruption.\n*   **Security Implications:** Heap-based buffer overflows can allow attackers to overwrite critical data structures, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n*   **Relationship to Other CWEs:** CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating that the overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking.\n*   **Primary/Secondary:** Secondary CWE\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The official MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-122, and it accurately represents the resulting buffer overflow on the heap.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): While relevant as a parent of CWE-122, it is less specific than CWE-122.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): The primary issue is a write, not a read.\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): The buffer size calculation is not the primary issue; the integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds access is.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While input validation is a factor, the integer overflow is the more direct cause.",
