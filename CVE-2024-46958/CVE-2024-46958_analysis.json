  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-46958:\n\n**Summary:** The provided content describes a bug fix related to incorrect file/folder permissions being set by the Nextcloud desktop client during synchronization. Specifically, the client was adding write permissions for \"group\" and \"others\" to folders, beyond the intended \"owner\" write permissions. This issue was resolved by narrowing the permissions to only the owner.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The Nextcloud desktop client, when setting `FileSystem::FolderPermissions::ReadWrite` on a folder, was incorrectly adding write permissions for the group and others, not just the owner. This was introduced in a previous change (PR #6839).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Excessive Permissions:** The client was granting broader write permissions than intended, making folders writable by group members and other users on the system.\n*   **Incorrect Permission Handling**: The client's logic for setting folder permissions was flawed, leading to unintended consequences.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Modification:**  Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow unintended users (group or others) to modify or delete data within synchronized folders, if they have local file access.\n*   **Privacy Violation**: If a user intended to have private folders, the incorrect permissions could expose the data to other users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local File Access**: An attacker must have local access to the system where the Nextcloud client is running, in order to leverage the excessive permissions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Local User**: The attacker needs to be a user on the system where the affected Nextcloud client is running and must be able to access the affected directory with the wrong permissions.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The issue was addressed in pull request #6949, which narrowed down the permissions to owner-only, and backported to the stable-3.13 branch via pull request #7092, resulting in the release of version 3.13.4.\n*   The bug was reported for versions 3.13.1, 3.13.2 and 3.13.3, and affected Linux and MacOS systems.\n*   The fix involves modifying how the client sets file system permissions when it encounters `FileSystem::FolderPermissions::ReadWrite`.\n\n**In summary, the vulnerability was due to the Nextcloud desktop client incorrectly setting folder permissions, granting write access to unintended users. The fix implemented in PR #6949 corrects the permission setting, narrowing down write permissions to only the owner of the folder and is available in version 3.13.4.**",

CWE-732 is a Class-level weakness describing incorrect permission assignment. CWE-689, a Compound weakness, requires both CWE-732 and CWE-362, but the description of the vulnerability does not indicate a resource copy is occurring.

The **root cause** is the **race condition** where the client incorrectly sets permissions during synchronization.\n\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is a Class-level weakness that matches the **race condition** described in the vulnerability description. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"race condition,\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explains how the client incorrectly sets permissions during synchronization.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a Class-level weakness that describes the incorrect assignment of permissions to a resource. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the Nextcloud desktop client was incorrectly adding write permissions for the group and others, not just the owner.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) and CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following). While these are related to race conditions, CWE-362 is a more general and appropriate fit for the provided information, as it does not specifically mention time-of-check/time-of-use issues or link following.\n\nThe description does not indicate a resource copy, so CWE-689 is not appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
