  "description": "The vulnerability allows any attacker to cause the PeerTube server to stop functioning, or in special cases send requests to arbitrary URLs (Blind SSRF). Attackers can send ActivityPub activities to PeerTubes inbox endpoint. By abusing the Create Activity functionality, it is possible to create crafted playlists which will cause either denial of service or an attacker-controlled blind SSRF.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-32948 Content\n\nHere's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-32948 as described in the initial prompt (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval).  Since the CVE description is a placeholder, the analysis relies on the details provided in the content.\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content from both `github.com` and `research.jfrog.com` directly relates to CVE-2025-32948. The GitHub release notes explicitly mention the CVE and link to the JFrog vulnerability report. The JFrog report details the vulnerability.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability details, extracted from the provided content:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    *   PeerTube's ActivityPub playlist creation process doesn't properly sanitize input, specifically the `url` field within ActivityPub objects.\n    *   The `fetchElementUrls`, `rebuildVideoPlaylistElements`, `buildElementsDBAttributes`, and `fetchRemotePlaylistElement` functions are involved in processing the playlist elements.\n    *   The `got` library is used for fetching remote resources, and improper handling of objects in the `url` field allows for manipulation of `got`'s options (e.g., enabling Unix sockets).\n    *   Lack of proper error handling in the `_destroy` function of `got` leads to server crashes.\n    *   The search functionality (`/api/v1/search/video-channels`) can be exploited if remote URI searching is enabled.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n    *   Denial of Service (DoS)\n    *   Improper Input Validation\n    *   Lack of Error Handling\n\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   **DoS:**  The server can be crashed, rendering it unavailable.\n    *   **SSRF:** An attacker can potentially make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs, potentially accessing sensitive resources.\n\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Crafted ActivityPub Create Activities with malicious `url` fields.\n    *   Exploiting the `/api/v1/search/video-channels` endpoint with a malicious URL when remote URI searching is enabled.\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   An attacker needs to be able to send ActivityPub Create Activities to the PeerTube instance (e.g., through federation).\n    *   For the search endpoint exploit, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permission to search remote URIs.\n\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   The content states \"No mitigations are supplied for this issue\" but links to a release (v7.1.1) that fixes the vulnerability.  The release notes indicate the vulnerability is fixed in v7.1.1.\n\n**3. Additional Details (Compared to a Placeholder CVE Description):**\n\nThe JFrog report provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes:\n\n*   A detailed explanation of the code flow leading to the vulnerability.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit.\n*   Specific function names involved.\n*   Information about the configuration option (`search.remote_uri`) that affects the attack surface.\n*   A link to PoC materials.\n\n**4. Unrelated Content:**\n\nThe content from `twitter.com` and the initial GitHub page content (regarding features, pricing, etc.) are unrelated to the vulnerability and have been excluded. The GitHub page error messages are also unrelated.\n\n**In summary, the provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2025-32948 and provides a comprehensive description of the vulnerability, its impact, and potential attack vectors.**",

CWE-400 and CWE-20 are class-level CWEs, indicating broader categories. CWE-918 is directly related to the **blind SSRF** described in the vulnerability. CWE-20 is a prerequisite for CWE-918, as **improper input validation** allows the SSRF to occur. CWE-400 is related to the **denial of service** impact, which is a consequence of the server crashing due to the SSRF vulnerability. The relationships can be visualized as follows:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe918 <--|CAUSED BY| cwe20\n    cwe400 <--|RESULT| cwe918\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the `url` field in ActivityPub objects. This leads to the **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** (CWE-918), which allows attackers to send requests to arbitrary URLs. The **SSRF** then causes the server to crash, leading to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Denial of Service)** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue allows attackers to cause a denial of service or send requests to arbitrary URLs (Blind SSRF) by abusing the Create Activity functionality with crafted playlists.\n\nThe CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is the improper sanitization of the `url` field within ActivityPub objects, leading to both SSRF and DoS.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between input validation, SSRF, and denial of service. CWE-918 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the core vulnerability. CWE-20 is added as a contributing factor, and CWE-400 is added to represent the impact.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-918 being a base-level CWE that directly matches the SSRF vulnerability. CWE-20 and CWE-400 are class-level CWEs that provide additional context about the root cause and impact.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))**: These were considered due to the \"Improper Neutralization\" aspect, but they are not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to web page generation or SQL commands.\n*   **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)**: While related to external entities, the vulnerability does not specifically involve XML, making CWE-918 a better fit.\n*   **CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting'))**: This is not applicable as there is no mention of CRLF injection.\n*   **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))**: This is not applicable as there is no mention of OS command injection.\n*   **CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute, CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication, CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check**: These are not applicable as these are not related to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**: This was considered, but the primary issue is not about encoding/escaping, but about SSRF.\n*   **CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')**: This is a class-level CWE and is too broad. CWE-918 is a more specific and appropriate base-level CWE.\n*   **CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements**: Similar to CWE-74, this is too broad and less specific than CWE-918.\n*   **CWE-346: Origin Validation Error**: This is related to validating the source of data, but SSRF is a more precise description.\n*   **CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**: This is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't directly involve the exposure of personal information.\n*   **CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration**: This is not applicable as session management is not involved in this vulnerability.",
