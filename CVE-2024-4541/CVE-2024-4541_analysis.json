  "description": "The Custom Product List Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** when modifying products. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, delete, bulk edit, approve or cancel products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4541\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by missing or incorrect nonce validation when modifying products within the Custom Product List Table plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin fails to properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   An attacker can add, delete, bulk edit, approve, or cancel products within the WordPress site.\n*   This could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized changes to products, and potentially other malicious activities depending on how the product data is used by the site.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attacker crafts a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin's functionality.\n*   The attacker must trick a site administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious page) which triggers the forged request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, typically by using social engineering.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   The plugin has been closed due to this security issue and is not available for download.\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Custom Product List Table plugin up to and including version 3.0.0.\n*   No patch is available; the recommended mitigation is to uninstall the plugin and find a replacement.\n*   The Wordfence vulnerability database entry for this CVE indicates it was discovered by Benedictus Jovan (aillesiM).",

CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a related CWE. CSRF can be viewed as a type of authorization bypass, where the application **incorrectly** assumes the request originates from a legitimate user due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, representing a combination of factors that enable the attack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**, leading to the possibility of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An unauthenticated attacker tricks a site administrator into performing an action, resulting in the attacker being able to add, delete, bulk edit, approve, or cancel products.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing or incorrect nonce validation**\nWeakness: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nImpact: Add, delete, bulk edit, approve, or cancel products\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-352 as the primary weakness due to the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**, which is a core requirement for preventing CSRF attacks. The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference details, both of which explicitly mention CSRF and the lack of nonce validation.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-352 is strong, with direct mentions in the vulnerability description key phrases (\"**weakness: cross-site request forgery**\", \"**rootcause: missing or incorrect nonce validation**\") and the CVE reference summary (\"**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin fails to properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.\").\n\nThe selection of CWE-352 is at the appropriate level of specificity, as it directly addresses the nature of the vulnerability. While CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is related, it is a more general class of weakness, and CSRF is a more precise description of the actual vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Technical Explanation:** The Custom Product List Table plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** when modifying products. This means the plugin does not properly verify if the request to modify products originated from a legitimate source (the user's authenticated session) or from a malicious site.\n**Security Implications:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a link or visiting a page that executes the request. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as adding, deleting, bulk editing, approving, or canceling products, as if they were the administrator.\n**Relationship Analysis:** CWE-352 is a compound weakness. It's related to CWE-862, Missing Authorization, but is more specific. In this case, the authorization failure occurs because the request is forged, bypassing the usual authorization checks.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-352 allows its use and acknowledges that it's a composite of multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Technical Explanation:** While the primary issue is CSRF, CWE-862 is related. The **missing or incorrect nonce validation** leads to an authorization bypass. The application fails to properly authorize the request, allowing unauthorized actions to be performed.\n**Security Implications:** The impact is that an unauthenticated attacker can perform administrative actions on the products.\n**Relationship Analysis:** CWE-862 is a class-level weakness. CWE-352 is a more specific case of missing authorization, where the authorization is bypassed due to a forged request.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-862 recommends considering more specific Base-level children if available, which supports choosing CWE-352 as the primary weakness.\n\n## CWEs Considered But Not Used:\n*   CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-116: These CWEs relate to injection and output encoding, which are not relevant to this vulnerability. The core issue is the **missing or incorrect nonce validation** that leads to CSRF, not improper handling of input or output.\n*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'): This CWE relates to inadequate authorization enforcement on restricted URLs. While CSRF can be seen as a form of forced browsing, CWE-352 is more specific to the mechanism of the attack (forged requests).\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function: This CWE addresses missing authentication. In this case, the administrator *is* authenticated, but the CSRF attack bypasses the authorization checks, making CWE-352 a more accurate classification.\n*   CWE-471, CWE-472: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter: These CWEs are not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve modifying assumed-immutable data. The core issue is the **lack of CSRF protection**.",
