# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-11831

# Vulnerability Description

    A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs because the **serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs**, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.
