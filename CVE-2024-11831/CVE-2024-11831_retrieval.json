  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-11831', description='A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs because the **serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs**, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs', 'weakness': ['Cross-site scripting', 'XSS attacks'], 'impact': 'inject malicious code', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'npm-serialize-javascript', 'version': '', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Here's the analysis of the content:\\n\\n**Content from access.redhat.com_c7d37915_20250624_115748.html**\\n\\n*   **Relevant Content:** This page describes Red Hat Product Errata RHBA-2025:0304, which is a Bug Fix Advisory for .NET 8.0.\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  N/A - This advisory focuses on bug fixes and enhancements rather than specific vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This advisory lists CVE-2024-11831 as a security vulnerability fixed by the update.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in serialize-javascript.\\n*   **Attack vectors:** Unknown\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unknown\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The advisory recommends applying the update for .NET 8.0 which includes the changes described in this advisory. The advisory also provides links to download the updated packages for various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.\\n*   **More Detail:**  The content provides details on the affected products and the packages available to address the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Content from github.com_c12384c5_20250624_115751.html**\\n\\n*   **Relevant Content:**  The content is a GitHub commit that fixes CVE-2024-11831, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `serialize-javascript` library.\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The `serialize-javascript` module did not properly sanitize URL strings, allowing for the injection of malicious code.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS).\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application.\\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft malicious input that, when serialized and deserialized, would execute unintended code.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that gets serialized and then deserialized by the vulnerable application.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**  The commit modifies the `index.js` and `test/unit/serialize.js` to serialize the URL string contents to prevent XSS. The fix involves encoding special characters in the URL to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML tags.\\n*   **More Detail:**  The content provides specific code changes that address the vulnerability, including the exact lines of code modified to implement the fix.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs because the **serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs**, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
