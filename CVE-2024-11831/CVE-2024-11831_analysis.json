  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-11831",
  "description": "A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs because the **serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs**, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.",

The secondary weakness, CWE-502, relates to deserialization of untrusted data, which can precede CWE-79 if the deserialized data contains malicious input. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a good level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of inputs by the `serialize-javascript` module (CWE-Other). This leads to the possibility of injecting malicious code. When this injected code is deserialized by a web browser, it results in Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is represented by CWE-79. CWE-502 may also be present in the chain since deserialization is mentioned.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the **serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs**, leading to **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks. This aligns well with CWE-79, \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\".\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-79 being a top candidate. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-79 is the most relevant Base CWE for XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-502 is included as a secondary concern because the description mentions deserialization of data, which is a potential attack vector that precedes XSS.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not chosen because they are either too general (e.g., CWE-138, CWE-116) or not directly related to the specific vulnerability (e.g., CWE-113, CWE-352). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing both the root cause (improper sanitization) and the resulting impact (XSS).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
