This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when unknowingly executed by an authenticated user, can lead to unintended actions.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\\n*   The specific impact is case-by-case and depends on the functionality exposed by the plugin without proper CSRF protection.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   The attacker leverages CSRF by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page containing the forged request.\\n*   The attack doesn't require any prior authentication.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and find a way to deliver it to a logged-in user of the affected WordPress site (e.g., via social engineering, malicious links, etc.).\\n*   The attacker does not require any specific access to the website to perform the attack.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is considered a low priority with a CVSS score of 7.1.\\n*   A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO on October 11, 2024.\\n*   There is no official fix available for the vulnerability as of the publication of this information.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Webriti Custom Login', 'keyphrase': 'Webriti Custom Login', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 0.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 0.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(321.9456080582338)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 0.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 0.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(221.21727689812099)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Webriti Custom Login', 'keyphrase': 'Webriti Custom Login', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 0.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 0.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(213.33826739032418)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
