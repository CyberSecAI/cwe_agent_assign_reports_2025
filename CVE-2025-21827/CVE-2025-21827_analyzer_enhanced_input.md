## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth btusb mediatek Add locks for usb_driver_claim_interface() The documentation for usb_driver_claim_interface() says that the device lock is needed when the function is called from places other than probe(). This appears to be the lock for the USB interface device. The Mediatek btusb code gets called via this path Workqueue hci0 hci_power_on [bluetooth] Call trace usb_driver_claim_interface btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf btusb_mtk_setup hci_dev_open_sync hci_power_on process_scheduled_works worker_thread kthread With the above call trace the device lock hasnt been claimed. Claim it. Without this fix, wed sometimes see the error Failed to claim iso interface. Sometimes wed even see worse errors, like a NULL pointer dereference (where `intf->dev.driver` was NULL) with a trace like Call trace usb_suspend_both usb_runtime_suspend __rpm_callback rpm_suspend pm_runtime_work process_scheduled_works Both errors appear to be fixed with the proper locking.
