  "keyphrases": {
    "rootcause": "The commit 83fccfc3940c introduced a race condition by using timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink(), which could lead to missing del_timer_sync() calls, and subsequently, a use-after-free.",
    "weakness": "Race condition in timer handling within reqsk_queue_unlink(). The check for timer_pending() can return an incorrect value if it happens immediately after detach_timer(), leading to the timer not being properly cancelled. The use of a bpf prog attached to trace_tcp_retransmit_synack triggers the bug."
