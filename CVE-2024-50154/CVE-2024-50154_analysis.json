  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tcp/dccp Dont use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink(). Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler(). We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null before using it. The commit 83fccfc3940c (inet fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()) added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a small race window. Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true) to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending. If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers() calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync() the reqsk timer will continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires. The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer expiration, which is 63s by default. The scenario would be 1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(), but del_timer_sync() is missed 2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again 3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets 4. sk is close()d 5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk Lets not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(). Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most use cases.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a race condition introduced by the commit `83fccfc3940c`, which aimed to fix a potential deadlock in `reqsk_queue_unlink()`. This commit added a check using `timer_pending()` to avoid calling `del_timer_sync()` from `reqsk_timer_handler()`. However, a race window exists where `reqsk_queue_unlink()` might check `timer_pending()` immediately after `expire_timers()` calls `detach_timer()`, which clears the timer's pending status, causing `del_timer_sync()` to be skipped.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Race Condition:** A race condition exists between `expire_timers()` detaching a timer and `reqsk_queue_unlink()` checking if the timer is pending.\n- **Use-After-Free:** If `del_timer_sync()` is skipped, the request socket (req) timer continues running, potentially accessing the socket (req->sk) after it has been closed, leading to a use-after-free.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Use-After-Free:** Exploitation results in a use-after-free condition when a BPF program attached to `trace_tcp_retransmit_synack` tries to access the freed socket via `req->sk`.\n- **Kernel Crash:** The use-after-free can lead to a kernel crash due to accessing invalid memory.\n- **Potential for other issues:** The missed `del_timer_sync()` can cause the timer to run again, sending multiple SYN+ACKs and potentially leading to other unexpected behavior.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **BPF Program:** A malicious or buggy BPF program attached to `trace_tcp_retransmit_synack` can trigger the vulnerability.\n- **TCP Connection Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered during specific TCP connection handling scenarios involving retransmissions, connection completion, and socket closing.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Kernel Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to load and attach a BPF program that uses `bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing` to `trace_tcp_retransmit_synack`. This may require root or admin privileges.\n- **Network Activity:** The attacker also needs to be able to initiate TCP connections that lead to retransmissions and trigger the race condition, which is a fairly common scenario.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability occurs because `reqsk_queue_unlink()` uses `timer_pending()` which can return a false negative after `detach_timer()` is called by `expire_timers()`.\n- The `reqsk` timer is pinned, which means the issue might not occur in all use cases, but the race condition can still occur.\n- The `req->sk` is not cleared in non-TFO sockets after `accept()` and `reqsk_put()`, making the UAF possible if the socket is closed while the timer is still running.\n\nThe provided patches address this by modifying `inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop` to accept a `from_timer` argument. When called from timer context (i.e. `reqsk_timer_handler`), the timer will not be deleted again. In other cases, it will use `timer_delete_sync()` instead of `timer_pending` to avoid the race condition. This ensures the timer is always properly cleaned up.",
