# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43380

## Vulnerability Description
fugit contains time tools for flor and the floraison group. The fugit natural parser, that turns every wednesday at 5pm into 0 17 * * 3, accepted any length of input and went on attempting to parse it, not returning promptly, as expected. The parse call could hold the thread with no end in sight. Fugit dependents that do not check (user) input length for plausibility are impacted. A fix was released in fugit 1.11.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** fugit
- **version:** before 1.11.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43380:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Fugit.parse` and related functions in the `fugit` gem (Ruby library) having poor time complexity when parsing "natural" language cron expressions. The parser would accept arbitrarily long input strings and attempt to parse them, leading to excessive resource consumption and potential thread hangs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The core weakness is the inefficient parsing algorithm in `Fugit::Nat.parse` and related methods that does not handle lengthy input strings gracefully. This leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser did not check the length of the input string, which could be supplied by users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could provide a long, crafted input string to the vulnerable `fugit` functions, causing the application to hang indefinitely or consume excessive resources, effectively leading to a denial of service. This would impact services using the `fugit` gem for scheduling tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of a long, malicious string to any of the vulnerable methods: `Fugit.parse(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse(s)`, `Fugit.parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`, and `Fugit::Nat.do_parse(s)`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input strings provided to the vulnerable `fugit` parsing methods. This could be through user-supplied data, configuration files, or other external inputs.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in [issue #104](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/104).
- The fix was implemented by limiting the length of the input string to 256 characters for the `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)` method.
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.11.1 of the `fugit` gem.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Low" severity rating.
- The fix was released in `fugit` version 1.11.1.
- Workarounds involve ensuring that input strings to the mentioned `fugit` functions are not excessively long and are vetted. A limit of 1000 characters is suggested as a safe value, while 10,000 causes stalling.
- The patch introduced a hard limit of 256 characters in `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`.
- Several downstream projects like `sidekiq-cron`, `good_job`, `solid_queue`, and `jets` have been updated to require `fugit` version 1.11.1 or greater to address this vulnerability.
