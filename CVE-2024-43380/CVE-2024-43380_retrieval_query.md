# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-43380

## Vulnerability Description
fugit contains time tools for flor and the floraison group. The fugit natural parser, that turns every wednesday at 5pm into 0 17 * * 3, accepted any length of input and went on attempting to parse it, not returning promptly, as expected. The parse call could hold the thread with no end in sight. Fugit dependents that do not check (user) input length for plausibility are impacted. A fix was released in fugit 1.11.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** fugit
- **version:** before 1.11.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43380:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Fugit.parse` and related functions in the `fugit` gem (Ruby library) having poor time complexity when parsing "natural" language cron expressions. The parser would accept arbitrarily long input strings and attempt to parse them, leading to excessive resource consumption and potential thread hangs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The core weakness is the inefficient parsing algorithm in `Fugit::Nat.parse` and related methods that does not handle lengthy input strings gracefully. This leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser did not check the length of the input string, which could be supplied by users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could provide a long, crafted input string to the vulnerable `fugit` functions, causing the application to hang indefinitely or consume excessive resources, effectively leading to a denial of service. This would impact services using the `fugit` gem for scheduling tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of a long, malicious string to any of the vulnerable methods: `Fugit.parse(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse(s)`, `Fugit.parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`, and `Fugit::Nat.do_parse(s)`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input strings provided to the vulnerable `fugit` parsing methods. This could be through user-supplied data, configuration files, or other external inputs.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in [issue #104](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/104).
- The fix was implemented by limiting the length of the input string to 256 characters for the `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)` method.
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.11.1 of the `fugit` gem.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Low" severity rating.
- The fix was released in `fugit` version 1.11.1.
- Workarounds involve ensuring that input strings to the mentioned `fugit` functions are not excessively long and are vetted. A limit of 1000 characters is suggested as a safe value, while 10,000 causes stalling.
- The patch introduced a hard limit of 256 characters in `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`.
- Several downstream projects like `sidekiq-cron`, `good_job`, `solid_queue`, and `jets` have been updated to require `fugit` version 1.11.1 or greater to address this vulnerability.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field
