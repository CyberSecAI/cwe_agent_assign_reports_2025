  "query": "A vulnerability was found in MicroWorld eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file rtscanner of the component Quarantine Handler. The manipulation leads to os command injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
