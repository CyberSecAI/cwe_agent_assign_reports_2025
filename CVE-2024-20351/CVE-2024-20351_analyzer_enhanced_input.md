## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the TCP/IP traffic handling function of the Snort Detection Engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause legitimate network traffic to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the **improper handling of TCP/IP network traffic**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of TCP/IP network traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FTD device to drop network traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected device must be rebooted to resolve the DoS condition.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper handling of TCP/IP network traffic**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** large amount of TCP/IP network traffic
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services
- **component:** TCP/IP traffic handling function of the Snort Detection Engine

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-20351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of TCP/IP network traffic within the Snort Detection Engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of TCP/IP network traffic leads to a denial of service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco FTD device to drop network traffic.
- This results in a denial of service (DoS) condition where legitimate network traffic is no longer processed.
- The affected device requires a reboot to restore normal functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, over the network.
- An attacker can send a large amount of TCP/IP network traffic through the affected device to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco FTD device.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FTD Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services that have either Snort 2 or Snort 3 enabled.
- On new installations of Cisco FTD Software 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is the default. Upgrades from earlier versions may default to Snort 2.
- The advisory notes that there are no workarounds.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and they are available for download.
- This advisory is part of the October 2024 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.6.
