# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-20351
## Query
A vulnerability in the TCP/IP traffic handling function of the Snort Detection Engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause legitimate network traffic to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP/IP network traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of TCP/IP network traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FTD device to drop network traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected device must be rebooted to resolve the DoS condition.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper handling of TCP', 'IP network traffic'
