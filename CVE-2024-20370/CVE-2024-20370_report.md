# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-20370

## Description

A vulnerability in the Cisco FXOS CLI feature on specific hardware platforms for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate their administrative privileges to root. The attacker would need valid administrative credentials on the device to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because certain system configurations and executable files have insecure storage and permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating on the device and then performing a series of steps that includes downloading malicious system files and accessing the Cisco FXOS CLI to configure the attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root access on the device.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-276, is a base-level CWE describing the root cause: **improper default permissions**. The secondary CWE, CWE-732, is a class-level CWE that is closely related and describes the impact of the weakness in a broader context. While CWE-732 is more general, it highlights the criticality of the resource affected. The relationship is that CWE-276 can lead to CWE-732 when a critical resource has incorrect permissions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with **insecure storage and permissions** (**CWE-276**). This allows an attacker with administrative privileges to download malicious system files, access the Cisco FXOS CLI, and configure an attack, ultimately leading to root access. The final impact is the elevation of privileges.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified that the **insecure storage and permissions** is the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence from "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states the root cause as "**insecure storage and permissions of system configurations and executable files**." This leads to a high confidence in the selection of CWE-276 and CWE-732. The graph relationships helped show the relationship between the root cause and the impact. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-276 directly addresses the **improper default permissions**, and CWE-732 highlights the significance of the affected resource.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1713.12
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1657.70
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
