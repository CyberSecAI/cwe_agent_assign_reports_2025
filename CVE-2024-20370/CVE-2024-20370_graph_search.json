The attacker would need valid administrative credentials on the device to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because certain system configurations and executable files have insecure storage and permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating on the device and then performing a series of steps that includes downloading malicious system files and accessing the Cisco FXOS CLI to configure the attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root access on the device. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-321 CWE-203 CWE-269 CWE-250 CWE-78 CWE-20 CWE-284 CWE-798 CWE-532",
