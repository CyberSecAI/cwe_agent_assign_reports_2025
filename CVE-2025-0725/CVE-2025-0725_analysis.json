This overflow leads to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Integer Overflow (CWE-680)\n*   Buffer Overflow\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nPotentially huge impact, but mitigated by the fact that vulnerable systems are likely already in a poor security state due to using a very old zlib version.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted HTTP response with gzip encoding.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP response content.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 8.12.0 or later.\n*   Apply the patch available at <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/76f83f0db23846e254d940ec7>.\n*   Use a modern zlib version (>= 1.2.0.4).\n*   Avoid using the `CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING` option.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability is a \"C mistake\" and likely avoidable with a different programming language.\n*   The vulnerable code path is rarely used, only triggered for older zlib versions due to compatibility reasons.\n*   The issue affects both libcurl and the curl command-line tool.\n*   zlib 1.2.0.4 was released in August 2003.\n*   The version check in the patch initially had an issue using string comparison instead of numeric comparison.\n*   The issue was reported on January 23, 2025, and a fix was released on February 5, 2025.\n*   A bounty of $505 USD was awarded for the report.\n*   The vulnerability only triggers when using zlib 1.2.0.3 or older.",

The integer overflow results in an incorrect calculation of buffer size, and subsequent memory operations write beyond the intended buffer boundaries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Integer Overflow** (CWE-190) during the calculation of a buffer size. This leads to allocation of a smaller-than-expected buffer. When data is written into this buffer without proper size checks, it overflows (CWE-120), overwriting adjacent memory regions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, both of which explicitly mention an **integer overflow** that results in a **buffer overflow**.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"an attacker-controlled **integer overflow** would make libcurl perform a **buffer overflow**.\"\nThe CVE reference summary states: \"An **integer overflow** in libcurl when performing automatic gzip decompression of content-encoded HTTP responses with `CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING`, specifically when using zlib 1.2.0.3 or older. This overflow leads to a **buffer overflow**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce this, showing that CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) can precede CWE-120 (Buffer Overflow).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately describing the root cause (integer overflow) and the immediate consequence (buffer overflow).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** Although the vulnerability involves gzip decompression, the core issue is the integer overflow, not the handling of compressed data itself.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The vulnerability is specifically an integer overflow, not an underflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** This is a consequence of CWE-190, the integer overflow is the ROOTCAUSE.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow, not a simple off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes, not an inconsistency in length parameters.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** This is a buffer overflow, not a buffer underwrite.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
