A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the affected machine.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires high privileges on the local machine.\n*   **Affected Products:** Dell Precision 7920 Rack and 7920 XL Rack systems with BIOS versions prior to 2.22.1.\n*   **Resolution:** Update BIOS to version 2.22.1 or later.\n\nThe provided document gives more specific information than what a typical CVE description would contain. Namely, it specifies the affected product lines, versions, and remediation steps.",

CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-200 is a Base-level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Improper Input Validation** as the root cause, which is why it's chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-200 is the resulting impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe20 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), which then leads to **Information Disclosure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that there is an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability which leads to **Information Disclosure**.\n```\nDell Precision Rack, 14G Intel BIOS versions prior to 2.22.2, contains an Improper Input Validation vulnerability. A high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to Information disclosure.\n```\nBased on this evidence:\n*   CWE-20, **Improper Input Validation**, is identified as the root cause (primary CWE).\n*   CWE-200, **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, is identified as the resulting impact (secondary CWE).\n\nThe retriever results also show that CWE-20 and CWE-200 are highly relevant given the key phrases in the vulnerability description. While other CWEs like CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) are listed, the description does not provide enough information to suggest memory corruption. Therefore, CWE-20 is the most appropriate root cause, leading to the information disclosure represented by CWE-200.
