# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1767

## Vulnerability Description
This CVE only affects Kubernetes clusters that utilize the in-tree gitRepo volume to clone git repositories from other pods within the same node. Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated and will not receive security updates upstream, any cluster still using this feature remains vulnerable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Kubernetes
- **component:** in-tree gitRepo volume

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability: A user with create pod permission can exploit gitRepo volumes to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node. This is because the in-tree gitRepo volume feature, when used, allows pods to clone git repositories from other pods on the same node.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The in-tree gitRepo volume feature in Kubernetes.
Impact of exploitation: Allows a user with create pod permission to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node.
Attack vectors: Exploitation of gitRepo volumes.
Required attacker capabilities/position: User with create pod permission.
Mitigation or fix:
*   Use an init container to perform the git clone operation and then mount the directory into the Pod's container.
*   Restrict the use of gitRepo volumes in your cluster using policies such as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy or through Restricted pod security standard policy. The following Common Expression Language (CEL) expression can be used as part of a policy to reject use of gitRepo volumes: `has(object.spec.volumes) || !object.spec.volumes.exists(v, has(v.gitRepo))`
