This is because the in-tree gitRepo volume feature, when used, allows pods to clone git repositories from other pods on the same node.\\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The in-tree gitRepo volume feature in Kubernetes.\\nImpact of exploitation: Allows a user with create pod permission to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node.\\nAttack vectors: Exploitation of gitRepo volumes.\\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: User with create pod permission.\\nMitigation or fix:\\n*   Use an init container to perform the git clone operation and then mount the directory into the Pod's container.\\n*   Restrict the use of gitRepo volumes in your cluster using policies such as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy or through Restricted pod security standard policy. The following Common Expression Language (CEL) expression can be used as part of a policy to reject use of gitRepo volumes: `has(object.spec.volumes) || !object.spec.volumes.exists(v, has(v.gitRepo))`\\n```\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '668', 'name': 'Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(87.52793558197583)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '88', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(81.50406143561227)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '923', 'name': 'Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(79.81351411463696)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '532', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(77.17123390000924)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '201', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(74.38508470631687)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '527', 'name': 'Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere', 'type': 'Variant', 'original_content': 'The product stores a CVS, git, or other repository in a directory, archive, or other resource that is stored, transferred, or otherwise made accessible to unauthorized actors.', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4.

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set.

The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Logged information may include up to 1024 bytes of the configuration including the username and password in an encrypted form and private keys used in any certificate profiles set for log forwarding server profiles. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature.

Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information.

A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability.

When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl.

SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0).

For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions. Insufficient capability checks made it possible to fetch other users' calendar action events.\n\n- CVE-2021-31548: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. A MediaWiki user who is partially blocked or was unsuccessfully blocked could bypass AbuseFilter and have their edits completed.\n\n- CVE-2021-31552: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).\n\n- CVE-2020-36289: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the QueryComponentRendererValue!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1. In some cases, there is improper enforcement of the privilege requirement for viewing a list of tickets that shows title, state, etc.\n\n- CVE-2021-22134: A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface.

This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39322: @keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.\n\n- CVE-2022-2462: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace.

In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24730: Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n\n- CVE-2009-3168: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n\n- CVE-2009-2960: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n- CVE-2009-3597: Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n- CVE-2009-2282: Terminal server does not check authorization for guest access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3230: Database server does not use appropriate privileges for certain sensitive operations.\n\n- CVE-2009-2213: Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n- CVE-2009-0034: Chain: product does not properly interpret a configuration option for a system group, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-6123: Chain: SNMP product does not properly parse a configuration option for which hosts are allowed to connect, allowing unauthorized IP addresses to connect.\n\n- CVE-2008-5027: System monitoring software allows users to bypass authorization by creating custom forms.\n\n- CVE-2008-7109: Chain: reliance on client-side security (CWE-602) allows attackers to bypass authorization using a custom client.\n\n- CVE-2008-3424: Chain: product does not properly handle wildcards in an authorization policy list, allowing unintended access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3781: Content management system does not check access permissions for private files, allowing others to view those files.\n\n- CVE-2008-4577: ACL-based protection mechanism treats negative access rights as if they are positive, allowing bypass of intended restrictions.\n\n- CVE-2008-6548: Product does not check the ACL of a page accessed using an \"include\" directive, allowing attackers to read unauthorized files.\n\n- CVE-2007-2925: Default ACL list for a DNS server does not set certain ACLs, allowing unauthorized DNS queries.\n\n- CVE-2006-6679: Product relies on the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for authorization, allowing unintended access by spoofing the header.\n\n- CVE-2005-3623: OS kernel does not check for a certain privilege before setting ACLs for files.\n\n- CVE-2005-2801: Chain: file-system code performs an incorrect comparison (CWE-697), preventing default ACLs from being properly applied.\n\n- CVE-2001-1155: Chain: product does not properly check the result of a reverse DNS lookup because of operator precedence (CWE-783), allowing bypass of DNS-based access restrictions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-24583: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability\n\n- CVE-2020-10697: A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running Openshift. Tower runs a memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n",

For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n",

For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.",

When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer.

For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file.

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2021-40496: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role).

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal message broker system. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to subscribe to arbitrary message queues.\n\n- CVE-2021-44523: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal activity feed database. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read, modify or delete activity feed entries.\n\n- CVE-2022-28160: Jenkins Tests Selector Plugin 1.3.3 and earlier allows users with Item/Configure permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-39015: Under certain conditions, BOE AdminTools/ BOE SDK allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted.\n\n- CVE-2022-32249: Under special integration scenario of SAP Business one and SAP HANA - version 10.0, an attacker can exploit HANA cockpit?s data volume to gain access to highly sensitive information (e.g., high privileged account credentials)\n\n- CVE-2022-26121: An exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668] in FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager GUI 7.0.0 through 7.0.3, 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, 6.2.0 through 6.2.9, 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, 5.6.0 through 5.6.11 may allow an unauthenticated and remote attacker to access report template images via referencing the name in the URL path.\n\n- CVE-2022-28924: An information disclosure vulnerability in UniverSIS-Students before v1.5.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted GET request to the endpoint /api/students/me/courses/.\n\n- CVE-2022-3866: HashiCorp Nomad and Nomad Enterprise 1.4.0 up to 1.4.1 workload identity token can list non-sensitive metadata for paths under nomad/ that belong to other jobs in the same namespace. Fixed in 1.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45438: When explicitly enabling the feature flag DASHBOARD_CACHE (disabled by default), the system allowed for an unauthenticated user to access dashboard configuration metadata using a REST API Get endpoint. This issue affects Apache Superset version 1.5.2 and prior versions and version 2.0.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-46756:  Dell VxRail, versions prior to 7.0.410, contain a Container Escape Vulnerability. A local high-privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the container's underlying OS. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker. \n\n- CVE-2022-22515: A remote, authenticated attacker could utilize the control program of the CODESYS Control runtime system to use the vulnerability in order to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected products.\n\n- CVE-2022-22732: A CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that could cause all remote domains to access the resources (data) supplied by the server when an attacker sends a fetch request from third-party site or malicious site. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Power Commission (Versions prior to V2.22)\n\n- CVE-2022-32530: A CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that could cause users to be misled, hiding alarms, showing the wrong server connection option or the wrong control request when a mobile device has been compromised by a malicious application. Affected Product: Geo SCADA Mobile (Build 222 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-34464: A vulnerability has been identified in SICAM GridEdge Essential ARM (All versions), SICAM GridEdge Essential Intel (All versions < V2.7.3), SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS ARM (All versions), SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS Intel (All versions < V2.7.3).

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0.

In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection.

The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information that includes user credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-33737: The OpenVPN Access Server installer creates a log file readable for everyone, which from version 2.10.0 and before 2.11.0 may contain a random generated admin password\n\n- CVE-2022-34826: In Couchbase Server 7.1.x before 7.1.1, an encrypted Private Key passphrase may be leaked in the logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20458: The logs of sensitive information (PII) or hardware identifier should only be printed in Android \"userdebug\" or \"eng\" build. StatusBarNotification.getKey() could contain sensitive information. However, CarNotificationListener.java, it prints out the StatusBarNotification.getKey() directly in logs, which could contain user's account name (i.e. PII), in Android \"user\" build.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-205567776\n\n- CVE-2022-20651: A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl.

SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions. Insufficient capability checks made it possible to fetch other users' calendar action events.\n\n- CVE-2021-31548: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. A MediaWiki user who is partially blocked or was unsuccessfully blocked could bypass AbuseFilter and have their edits completed.\n\n- CVE-2021-31552: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).\n\n- CVE-2020-36289: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the QueryComponentRendererValue!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1. In some cases, there is improper enforcement of the privilege requirement for viewing a list of tickets that shows title, state, etc.\n\n- CVE-2021-22134: A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators.

An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24783: Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The versions of Deno between release 1.18.0 and 1.20.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to an attack where a malicious actor controlling the code executed in a Deno runtime could bypass all permission checks and execute arbitrary shell code. This vulnerability does not affect users of Deno Deploy. The vulnerability has been patched in Deno 1.20.3. There is no workaround. All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately.\n\n- CVE-2022-25318: An issue was discovered in Cerebrate through 1.4. An incorrect sharing group ACL allowed an unprivileged user to edit and modify sharing groups.\n\n- CVE-2022-27575: Information exposure vulnerability in One UI Home prior to SMR April-2022 Release 1 allows to access currently launched foreground app information without permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-35716: IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) 6.2.0.0 through 6.2.7.16, 7.0.0.0 through 7.0.5.11, 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.2.7, and 7.2.0.0 through 7.2.3.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in some instances due to improper security checking. IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, and 3.6.5. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-24307: Mastodon before 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6 has incorrect access control because it does not compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. (JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.)\n\n- CVE-2022-24714: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

This could result in a user disabling anti-tampering mechanisms which would then allow the user to disable Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27609: Forcepoint One Endpoint prior to version 22.01 installed on Microsoft Windows does not provide sufficient anti-tampering protection of services by users with Administrator privileges. This could result in a user disabling Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27668: Depending on the configuration of the route permission table in file 'saprouttab', it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to execute SAProuter administration commands in SAP NetWeaver and ABAP Platform - versions KERNEL 7.49, 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, 7.87, 7.88, KRNL64NUC 7.49, KRNL64UC 7.49, SAP_ROUTER 7.53, 7.22, from a remote client, for example stopping the SAProuter, that could highly impact systems availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-31039: Greenlight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39322: @keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js. Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field.\n\n- CVE-2022-41274: SAP Disclosure Management - version 10.1, allows an authenticated attacker to exploit certain misconfigured application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to the exposure of data like financial reports.\n\n- CVE-2022-4167: Incorrect Authorization check affecting all versions of GitLab EE from 13.11 prior to 15.5.7, 15.6 prior to 15.6.4, and 15.7 prior to 15.7.2 allows group access tokens to continue working even after the group owner loses the ability to revoke them.\n\n- CVE-2022-41962: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6, and 2.5-alpha-1 contain Incorrect Authorization for setting emoji status. A user with moderator rights can use the clear status feature to set any emoji status for other users. Moderators should only be able to set none as the status of other users. This issue is patched in 2.4-rc-6 and 2.5-alpha-1There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-42351: Adobe Experience Manager version 6.5.14 (and earlier) is affected by an Incorrect Authorization vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass.

There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated and will not receive security updates upstream, any cluster still using this feature remains vulnerable.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **product:** Kubernetes\n- **component:** in-tree gitRepo volume\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n```\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A user with create pod permission can exploit gitRepo volumes to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node. This is because the in-tree gitRepo volume feature, when used, allows pods to clone git repositories from other pods on the same node.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The in-tree gitRepo volume feature in Kubernetes.\nImpact of exploitation: Allows a user with create pod permission to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node.\nAttack vectors: Exploitation of gitRepo volumes.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: User with create pod permission.\nMitigation or fix:\n*   Use an init container to perform the git clone operation and then mount the directory into the Pod's container.\n*   Restrict the use of gitRepo volumes in your cluster using policies such as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy or through Restricted pod security standard policy. The following Common Expression Language (CEL) expression can be used as part of a policy to reject use of gitRepo volumes: `has(object.spec.volumes) || !object.spec.volumes.exists(v, has(v.gitRepo))`\n```\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.088 |\n| 2 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.082 |\n| 3 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.080 |\n| 4 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.077 |\n| 5 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.074 |\n| 6 | 527 | Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.488 |\n| 7 | 942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 61 | UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.073 |\n| 9 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.072 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.072 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nResources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** A \"control sphere\" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for \"administrators\" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be \"users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed.\" Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If these subdirectories are stored on a web server or added to an archive, then these could be used by an attacker. This information may include usernames, filenames, path root, IP addresses, and detailed \"diff\" data about how files have been changed - which could reveal source code snippets that were never intended to be made public.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-552\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA cross-domain policy file (\"crossdomain.xml\" in Flash and \"clientaccesspolicy.xml\" in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.\n\n\nTherefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.\n\n\nAn overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.\n\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-183\nCanPrecede -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-2292:** Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.\n- **CVE-2014-2049:** The default Flash Cross Domain policies in a product allows remote attackers to access user files.\n- **CVE-2007-6243:** Chain: Adobe Flash Player does not sufficiently restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSymlink following\nsymlink vulnerability\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\nRequires -> CWE-362\nRequires -> CWE-340\nRequires -> CWE-386\nRequires -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nA process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied, especially environment variables.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1387:** password passed on command line\n- **CVE-2005-2291:** password passed on command line\n- **CVE-2001-1565:** username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",

        "matched_text": "CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nResources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2021-40496: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role). Users in the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve managed-network data that was not set to be accessible to the entire group (i.e., was only set to be accessible to a subset of that group).\n\n- CVE-2021-44524: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options.

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Logged information may include up to 1024 bytes of the configuration including the username and password in an encrypted form and private keys used in any certificate profiles set for log forwarding server profiles. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

It incorrectly logged sensitive suppression deletions, which should not have been visible to users with access to view AbuseFilter log data.\n\n- CVE-2021-3167: In Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) 1.3.0, JWT authentication tokens are exposed to administrators in virtual cluster server logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-39913: Accidental logging of system root password in the migration log in all versions of GitLab CE/EE before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 allows an attacker with local file system access to obtain system root-level privileges\n\n- CVE-2021-21722: A ZTE Smart STB is impacted by an information leak vulnerability. The device did not fully verify the log, so attackers could use this vulnerability to obtain sensitive user information for further information detection and attacks. This affects: ZXV10 B860A V2.1-T_V0032.1.1.04_jiangsuTelecom.\n\n- CVE-2021-22184: An information disclosure issue in GitLab starting from version 12.8 allowed a user with access to the server logs to see sensitive information that wasn't properly redacted.\n\n- CVE-2021-37036: There is an information leakage vulnerability in FusionCompute 6.5.1, eCNS280_TD V100R005C00 and V100R005C10. Due to the improperly storage of specific information in the log file, the attacker can obtain the information when a user logs in to the device. Successful exploit may cause the information leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-36318: Dell EMC Avamar versions 18.2,19.1,19.2,19.3,19.4 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A high privileged user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a complete outage.\n\n- CVE-2022-23506: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature.

Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion.

When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root.

Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability.

When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel.

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-137395936\n\n- CVE-2021-22490: There is a Permission verification vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the device performance.\n\n- CVE-2021-38137: Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 does not correctly check swa-monitor and cns-monitor user\u2019s privileges, allowing a user to perform actions not belonging to his role.\n\n- CVE-2021-39119: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow users who have watched an issue to continue receiving updates on the issue even after their Jira account is revoked, via a Broken Access Control vulnerability in the issue notification feature. The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl.

SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0).

For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon.

There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24730: Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n\n- CVE-2009-3168: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n\n- CVE-2009-2960: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n- CVE-2009-3597: Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n- CVE-2009-2282: Terminal server does not check authorization for guest access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3230: Database server does not use appropriate privileges for certain sensitive operations.\n\n- CVE-2009-2213: Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n- CVE-2009-0034: Chain: product does not properly interpret a configuration option for a system group, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-6123: Chain: SNMP product does not properly parse a configuration option for which hosts are allowed to connect, allowing unauthorized IP addresses to connect.\n\n- CVE-2008-5027: System monitoring software allows users to bypass authorization by creating custom forms.\n\n- CVE-2008-7109: Chain: reliance on client-side security (CWE-602) allows attackers to bypass authorization using a custom client.\n\n- CVE-2008-3424: Chain: product does not properly handle wildcards in an authorization policy list, allowing unintended access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3781: Content management system does not check access permissions for private files, allowing others to view those files.\n\n- CVE-2008-4577: ACL-based protection mechanism treats negative access rights as if they are positive, allowing bypass of intended restrictions.\n\n- CVE-2008-6548: Product does not check the ACL of a page accessed using an \"include\" directive, allowing attackers to read unauthorized files.\n\n- CVE-2007-2925: Default ACL list for a DNS server does not set certain ACLs, allowing unauthorized DNS queries.\n\n- CVE-2006-6679: Product relies on the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for authorization, allowing unintended access by spoofing the header.\n\n- CVE-2005-3623: OS kernel does not check for a certain privilege before setting ACLs for files.\n\n- CVE-2005-2801: Chain: file-system code performs an incorrect comparison (CWE-697), preventing default ACLs from being properly applied.\n\n- CVE-2001-1155: Chain: product does not properly check the result of a reverse DNS lookup because of operator precedence (CWE-783), allowing bypass of DNS-based access restrictions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-24583: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability\n\n- CVE-2020-10697: A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running Openshift. Tower runs a memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values. Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.\n\n- CVE-2021-1839: The issue was addressed with improved permissions logic.

When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer.

The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.",
