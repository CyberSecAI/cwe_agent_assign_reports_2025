## Vulnerability Description
** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** **Improper Authentication vulnerability** in Apache Submarine Commons Utils. If the user doesnt explicitly set `submarine.auth.default.secret`, a default value will be used. This issue affects Apache Submarine Commons Utils from 0.8.0. As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Authentication vulnerability**
- **product:** Apache Submarine Commons Utils
- **version:** from 0.8.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded default secret (`SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET`) within the Apache Submarine Commons Utils. This means that if the application is deployed without configuring a custom secret, all installations would share the same secret, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the use of a default, hard-coded authentication secret. This violates the principle of secure defaults, as the default secret is known to the developers and could be potentially discovered by malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as "low", but if exploited, it could lead to unauthorized access to systems relying on this component for authentication. The degree of impact would depend on the scope of the affected systems. This is further mitigated by the fact that the project is retired.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker who has knowledge of the default secret could leverage it to bypass authentication mechanisms in systems using the vulnerable Apache Submarine Commons Utils library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the hard-coded default secret. If that secret is not changed by a user, any user knowing the secret can access the service. No particular network position is mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by retrieving the `SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET` from an environment variable rather than using the hardcoded value. This is described in the provided link to the pull request ([https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125](https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125)). However, the fix was not released and the project is retired.
*   The CVE description notes that this vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Users are advised to find an alternative.
*   The provided content indicates some disagreement on the fix, suggesting it should be revisited. However, as the project is archived, no further action is likely.
*   The issue is tracked as `SUBMARINE-1417`.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
