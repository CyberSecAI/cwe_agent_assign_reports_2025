This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

\"vulnerability_details\": [\\n  {\\n   \"root_cause\": \"The vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials and a session key system in the eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce

access.\",\\n   \"impact\": \"An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including PHP shells, to the WordPress root or any writable directory, leading to remote code execution.\",\\n   \"attack_vector\": \"The attack vector involves sending a POST request to the `?connector=bridge` endpoint with the default hash to obtain a session key and then using the session key with the `set_file` task to upload a malicious file.\",\\n   \"attack_capabilities\": \"The attacker needs to know the existence of the `?connector=bridge` endpoint, and the default credentials or the default

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **arbitrary file uploads** due to **missing file type validation** in the set_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing file type validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
