# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4336

# Vulnerability Description

    The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **arbitrary file uploads** due to **missing file type validation** in the set_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.
