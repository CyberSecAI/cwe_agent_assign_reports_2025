  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function AssimpMD3ImporterValidateSurfaceHeaderOffsets of the file code/AssetLib/MD3/MD3Loader.cpp of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
