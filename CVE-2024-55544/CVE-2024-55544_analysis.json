  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55544:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The root cause is a command injection vulnerability present in the webserver of the ORing IAP-420 device. Specifically, it is located in the `even_log.cgi` script.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system via the `tf_logserver_port` parameter within a POST request to `/cgi-bin/even_log.cgi`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system. This results in complete control over the device.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the device by sending a crafted POST request to the `even_log.cgi` script.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker must be authenticated to the web interface of the device to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject a command (`touch /tmp/test`) by manipulating the `tf_logserver_port` parameter.\n*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization or validation, enabling the injection of shell commands.\n*   The vulnerability is present in the ORing IAP-420 device with firmware version 2.01e.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by students during a lecture at the UAS St. P\u00f6lten, with support from CyberDanube and the MEDUSA platform.\n*   The vendor was contacted multiple times without response.\n*   No patch is available as of the time of disclosure.\n*   A workaround is to restrict network access to the device and restrict access to the management interface.\n*   The security advisory recommends changing the hardware.",
