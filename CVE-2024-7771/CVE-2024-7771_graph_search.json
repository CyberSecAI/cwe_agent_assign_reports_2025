Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-789 CWE-1284 CWE-401 CWE-770 CWE-1333 CWE-259 CWE-918",
