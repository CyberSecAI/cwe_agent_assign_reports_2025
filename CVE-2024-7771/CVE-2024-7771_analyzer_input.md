# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7771

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** localWhisper implementation
- **vector:** uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate
- **product:** mintplex-labs/anything-llm
- **impact:** denial of service, crash the entire site instance
- **version:** latest

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to a commit in the `anything-llm` repository on GitHub. The commit message indicates "Audio file validations" and includes a patch to support wavfile parsing with sharp.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit addresses the need for audio file validations to prevent potential issues during processing.  Specifically, it appears to mitigate risks associated with invalid or malicious audio files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The commit doesn't explicitly state a vulnerability, but implies that without validation, the system was susceptible to issues caused by invalid audio files (e.g., incorrect sample rate, excessive duration, or potentially malicious content).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Without validation, processing invalid audio files could lead to crashes, errors, or potentially allow for denial-of-service attacks or other exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could provide crafted audio files with invalid parameters (sample rate, duration, or content) to trigger errors or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the audio processing pipeline.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to provide audio files to the system, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a file upload feature).

**Mitigation or fix:**
The commit introduces the following validations:
*   **Sample Rate Check:** Ensures the audio file's sample rate is at least 4kHz.
*   **Duration Check:** Limits the audio file duration to a maximum of 4 hours.
*   **Sample Count Check:** Prevents memory issues by limiting the number of samples after upsampling.
*   The commit also updates the `sharp` library to version 0.33.5 to support wavfile parsing.

The commit also includes changes to the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files, indicating dependency updates, specifically to `sharp`.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely provide, as it details the specific validation checks implemented.
