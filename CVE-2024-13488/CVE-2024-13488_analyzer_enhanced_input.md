## Vulnerability Description
The LTL Freight Quotes Estes Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the dropship_edit_id and edit_id parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
