  "description": "Altair is a fork of Misskey v12. Affected versions **lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy** for compressing and resizing remote files could allow attacks that could affect availability, such as by abnormally increasing the CPU usage of the server on which this software is running or placing a heavy load on the network it is using. This issue has been fixed in v12.24Q4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of request validation and missing authentication in the media/file proxy, specifically when handling remote files for compression and resizing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Uncontrolled Recursion**: The description mentions \"Uncontrolled Recursion\" as part of the title of the security advisory.\n- **Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)**: The vulnerability leads to an amplification effect, as it allows attackers to consume excessive resources on the server.\n- **Missing Request Validation:** There is insufficient validation of requests made to the media/file proxy.\n- **Missing Authentication:**  The proxy does not require proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to its functionalities.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause abnormal increases in CPU usage on the server and generate significant load on the network.\n- **Availability Impact:** The attacks can impact the availability of the service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network**: The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user accounts to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The vulnerability is similar to one found in the upstream project ([https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v23600](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v23600)).\n- The fix was implemented in commit `20bad5155a8d73f8d807c6c1ae0f7b8041331be8` which added authentication by checking for a valid user token before proceeding with media proxy requests.\n- The vulnerability is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.6.\n- The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) was modified as part of the fix to restrict media sources to 'self', preventing loading of remote media.",

CWE-770 and CWE-1284 are related as potential consequences of the missing authentication, leading to resource exhaustion. CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), reflecting the possibility of uncontrolled resource allocation.

This is evidenced by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which states \"**lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy**\". This aligns directly with CWE-306. The impact, such as increased CPU usage and heavy network load, are consequences of this primary weakness.
