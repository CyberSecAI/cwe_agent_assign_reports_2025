CWE-732 is a Class, and there might be more specific Base-level children that could be applicable. The mapping guidance emphasizes using the most specific CWE available. However, based on the available information, CWE-732 directly addresses the **incorrect permission** issue. CWE-522 was considered because the impact includes leaked credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe732 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient permissions** leading to the potential leakage of NTLM hashes.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-732 - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource: **Insufficient permissions** are assigned, allowing a low-privileged user to access critical resources related to credential handling.\n2.  **Impact:** CWE-522 - Insufficiently Protected Credentials: As a consequence of the incorrect permission assignment, NTLM hashes are leaked.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **insufficient permissions** as the root cause, which aligns with CWE-732. The retriever results also suggested several relevant CWEs related to authorization and privilege management. However, CWE-732 directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment** for critical resources, making it the most appropriate primary CWE. The fact that leaked credentials are the result of this **incorrect permission assignment** makes CWE-522 a candidate.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description key phrases, which explicitly state **insufficient permissions** as the root cause. The CVE reference links content summary further supports this by highlighting that the vulnerability stems from inadequate permission controls in how credentials are handled.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 is based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to an **incorrect permission assignment** issue. The level of specificity is appropriate, as it captures the essence of the vulnerability without being overly generic. Other CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant based on the specific details provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
