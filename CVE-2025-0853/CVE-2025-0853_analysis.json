The impact is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database and append additional SQL queries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an SQL injection vulnerability due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. The vulnerability occurs in the PGS Core plugin for WordPress, where the 'event' parameter in the save_header_builder function is vulnerable. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), because the root cause is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** which allows the attacker to inject malicious SQL commands.\n\nThe evidence for this is explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\" and \"**weakness:** **SQL injection**\".\n\nThe retriever results also supports this by listing CWE-89 as the top match.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected:\n\n*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): While related to escaping, CWE-89 is more specific to SQL injection, making it a better fit.\n*   CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')): This is specific to LDAP injection, not SQL injection.\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): This is a different type of vulnerability and not applicable here.\n*   CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements): This is less specific than CWE-89.\n*   CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data): This is a different type of vulnerability and not applicable here.\n*   CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic): This is a more general class, and CWE-89 is more specific to the SQL context.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This is a different type of vulnerability and not applicable here.\n*   CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')): This is a different type of injection, not SQL.\n*   CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration): This is a different type of vulnerability and not applicable here.",
