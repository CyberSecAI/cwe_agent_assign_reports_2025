## Vulnerability Description
When reading data from disk, the grubs UDF filesystem module utilizes the user controlled data length metadata to allocate its internal buffers. In certain scenarios, while iterating through disk sectors, it assumes the read size from the disk is always smaller than the allocated buffer size which is not guaranteed. A crafted filesystem image may lead to a **heap-based buffer overflow** resulting in critical data to be corrupted, resulting in the risk of arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** grubs UDF filesystem module
- **vector:** crafted filesystem image
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution, bypass secure boot protections, corruption of critical data

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-0689 is related to the provided content. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The grub's UDF filesystem module utilizes user-controlled data length metadata to allocate its internal buffers. It assumes the read size from the disk is always smaller than the allocated buffer size, which is not guaranteed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

Heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Critical data corruption, arbitrary code execution, bypassing secure boot protections.

**Attack vectors:**

Crafted filesystem image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

Ability to create a malicious filesystem image.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The patch set contains fixes for the vulnerability. Updated GRUB2, shim, and other boot artifacts from affected vendors will be made available. Applying the latest SBAT (Secure Boot Advanced Targeting) data is also required.

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**

*   Reported by: Jonathan Bar Or
*   CVSS: 3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - 6.4
*   The vulnerability is in `grub_udf_read_block()`.
