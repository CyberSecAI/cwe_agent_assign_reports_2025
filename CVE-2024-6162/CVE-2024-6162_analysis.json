  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where **URL-encoded request paths can be mishandled during concurrent requests on the AJP listener**. This issue arises because the same buffer is used to decode the paths for multiple requests simultaneously, leading to incorrect path information being processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path, causing errors such as 404 Not Found or other application failures. This flaw can potentially lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6162:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability lies in how Undertow handles URL-encoded request paths, specifically when using the AJP listener.\n- The same buffer is used to decode paths for multiple concurrent requests.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect Path Handling:** Due to the shared buffer, the path information for concurrent requests can become mixed up. This results in the server attempting to access the wrong resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a potential denial of service. This occurs because legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up, leading to errors like \"404 Not Found\" or other application failures.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Concurrent Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered when multiple requests are made to the server concurrently.\n- **URL-Encoded Paths:** The issue arises specifically when the request path contains URL-encoded characters.\n- **AJP Listener:** The vulnerability is specific to the AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) listener within Undertow.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to send multiple, concurrent requests to a server using the AJP listener and with URL-encoded paths.  No special privileges are required.\n\n**Summary of Affected Products:**\n\nBased on the provided advisories, the following products are confirmed to be affected:\n\n-   NetApp:\n    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux\n    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows\n    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere\n\n-   Red Hat:\n    *   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0.1 (fixed in RHSA-2024:1194)\n\t*   Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.4.17 XP 4.0.2 (fixed in RHSA-2024:4386)\n    *   Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot (fixed in RHSA-2024:4884)\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating it is network-accessible, requires no special privileges or user interaction, and has a high impact on availability.\n- Patches and updates are available for the affected Red Hat products.\n- NetApp is still investigating and releasing fixes for the affected products.\n\nThis information is derived from multiple sources and should give a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.",

This is a Class-level CWE. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is selected as a secondary CWE because the race condition can lead to resource exhaustion. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a child of CWE-400 and is considered as a more specific root cause, where resources aren't properly managed during allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **race condition** (CWE-362) due to the **improper synchronization** of access to a shared buffer. This leads to **incorrect path handling**, which in turn can result in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and potentially a denial-of-service. **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (CWE-770) contributes to the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the **race condition** described in the vulnerability, where the same buffer is used to decode paths for multiple requests concurrently, leading to incorrect path information. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this, stating that \"the vulnerability lies in how Undertow handles URL-encoded request paths, specifically when using the AJP listener\" and that \"the same buffer is used to decode paths for multiple concurrent requests\". The primary impact is a denial of service.\n\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is the most relevant because the core issue is the concurrent access to a shared resource (the buffer) without proper synchronization. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) are included as contributing factors because the **incorrect path handling** caused by the **race condition** can potentially lead to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe relationships between the CWEs influenced the selection. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating a potential path to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-362 captures the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-400 and CWE-770 capture the potential consequences of the **race condition**.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the consumption of resources, such as memory, CPU, or network bandwidth, which can lead to a denial of service.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
