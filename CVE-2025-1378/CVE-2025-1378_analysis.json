This leads to a crash due to the `AddressSanitizer: negative-size-param` error. Specifically, the issue occurs when using the `rasm2 -i 6 -E` command.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A negative-size-param vulnerability, which can lead to a crash.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** The exploitation of the vulnerability results in a crash of the `rasm2` tool.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific command-line input: `rasm2 -i 6 -E 'mov eax, 30'`.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `rasm2` command with the specified arguments.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit c6c772d addresses the issue. The fix involves adding checks for invalid lengths and skip values in `rasm_disasm` and `r_main_rasm2` functions within `libr/main/rasm2.c`.\n\n**Content from github.com_5973274d_20250624_185340.html (stripped)**\n\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit c6c772d addresses the issue.

CWE-787 and CWE-125 are more specific variants of CWE-119.

This leads directly to an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)** and the observed crash. A potential contributing factor could be an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size (CWE-131)**, though this is not explicitly stated but can lead to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The vulnerability stems from a negative size parameter being passed to the `memmove` function... This leads to a crash due to the `AddressSanitizer: negative-size-param` error.\" This clearly indicates an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)** as the primary weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-787 as the most relevant CWE. The graph relationships show that CWE-787 can follow CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and is a parent of CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite), further solidifying its relevance. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a closely related weakness and is considered as a secondary candidate. The fix involves adding checks for invalid lengths, suggesting a possible connection to CWE-131.\n\nCWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer) was considered, but CWE-787 is more specific to the actual write operation causing the crash, so it was preferred. CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) was also considered but is not directly supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
