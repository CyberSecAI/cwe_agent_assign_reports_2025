While other CWEs were considered, none provided as precise a fit. Specifically, the **weakness** is a **cross-site scripting**, which means improper neutralization of input during web page generation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input**, which leads directly to **cross-site scripting**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and resulting conclusion are strongly supported by the evidence provided. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **weakness** is **cross-site scripting** due to manipulation of the `scripts` argument. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-79 as the primary match.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on its precise match to the vulnerability description and the provided evidence.

While other CWEs were considered, none provided as precise a fit. Specifically, the **weakness** is a **cross-site scripting**, which means improper neutralization of input during web page generation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input**, which leads directly to **cross-site scripting**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and resulting conclusion are strongly supported by the evidence provided. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **weakness** is **cross-site scripting** due to manipulation of the `scripts` argument. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-79 as the primary match.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on its precise match to the vulnerability description and the provided evidence.
