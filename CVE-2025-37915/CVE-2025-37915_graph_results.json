  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched drr Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdiscs enqueue callback reentrant. In the case of drr, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption. In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether the class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before adding to the list to cover for the reentrant case.
