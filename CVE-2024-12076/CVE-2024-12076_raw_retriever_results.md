# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-12076
## Query
The Target Video Easy Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the resync_carousel(), seek_snapshot(), uploaded_cc(), and remove_cc() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'missing', 'incorrect nonce validation'
- **weakness**: 'Cross-Site Request Forgery'
