### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access controls**
- **product:** D-Link DIR-816 A2
- **version:** 1.10CNB05_R1B011D88210
- **component:** /goform/form2Dhcpd.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper access control vulnerability in the web management interface of the D-Link DIR-816A2 router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper authentication or access control on the `form2Dhcpd.cgi` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to send HTTP POST requests to this endpoint and manipulate DHCP service settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the DHCP settings of the router. This could lead to various attacks, including:
*   Denial of Service (DoS): By modifying the DHCP settings, attackers could prevent legitimate devices from obtaining IP addresses, disrupting network connectivity.
*   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: By setting the router to provide attacker-controlled DNS servers or default gateways through DHCP, attackers could redirect network traffic through their own systems, enabling interception of data and credential theft.
*   Network Hijacking: By manipulating the DHCP scope, attackers can control which devices connect and obtain IP addresses on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through an unauthenticated HTTP POST request to the `goform` endpoint with the `form2Dhcpd.cgi` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web management interface. This would usually require the attacker to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to the web interface if exposed to the internet. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
