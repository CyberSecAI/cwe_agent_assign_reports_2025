# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-4079

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves a buffer overflow due to the lack of input size validation during a buffer copy operation in the RENAME command handler of the FTP server. |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.8 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. This is a broader category that encompasses buffer overflows. CWE-120 is a more specific case. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-120, which is a base-level CWE describing a buffer copy without checking the size of the input. This is a specific type of buffer overflow. CWE-119 is a parent class encompassing memory buffer boundary violations. The relationship between CWE-120 and CWE-119 is ChildOf. This means that CWE-120 is a specific type of CWE-119.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to a **buffer overflow** when copying data into a buffer without checking its size. This can then lead to arbitrary code execution.
  - **Root Cause**: **Improper Input Validation** (not explicitly CWE'd but the underlying cause)
  - **Weakness**: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
  - **Impact**: Arbitrary code execution

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** in the RENAME command handler of PCMan FTP Server. The server **does not properly validate the length of the input provided in the RENAME command**, allowing an attacker to send a string longer than the allocated buffer. This is a clear case of CWE-120, "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')". CWE-119, "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer," is a more general category, and while applicable, CWE-120 is more precise. The vulnerability description and the detailed exploit information provided in the CVE reference links content summary provides strong evidence for this assessment. The confidence score is 1.0 as the evidence is strong and the root cause is evident. The retriever results also supports this selection and lists CWE-120 as a strong candidate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to uploading dangerous file types.

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to format string usage.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to authorization on URLs.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because it is related to injection, not buffer overflows.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not directly relevant as the **buffer overflow** is due to **not checking the input size** when copying, not necessarily an incorrect calculation of the buffer size, though it could be a contributing factor.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to SSRF.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to an off-by-one error.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE is too broad and not specific to buffer overflows.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the
