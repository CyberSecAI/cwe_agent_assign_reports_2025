  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4079 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server, specifically a remote buffer overflow in the `RENAME` command. It provides a detailed exploit script.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `RENAME` command handling of PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7. The server does not properly validate the length of the input provided in the `RENAME` command, allowing an attacker to send a string longer than the allocated buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Buffer Overflow\n*   Improper Input Validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the execution flow of the program, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system. The exploit script aims to redirect execution to a shellcode payload.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the FTP protocol.\n*   Specifically, sending a crafted `RENAME` command to the FTP server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the target FTP server on port 21.\n*   Ability to send crafted FTP commands.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide information about a specific fix. However, the root cause suggests that proper input validation and buffer size checks in the `RENAME` command handling would mitigate the vulnerability. Updating to a patched version of PCMan FTP Server is recommended.\n\n**Technical Details & Exploit Information:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7\n*   **Tested on:** Windows XP SP3 (Version 5.1 Build 2600)\n*   **Offset:** 2004 bytes\n*   **EIP overwrite:** `0x74e32fd9` (JMP ESP)\n*   **Bad characters:** `\\x00\\x0a\\x0d`\n*   **Payload:** The script constructs a payload containing:\n    *   A large string of 'A' characters to fill the buffer.\n    *   The address of a `JMP ESP` instruction to redirect execution to the shellcode.\n    *   NOP sled (`\\x90`x20) to increase the chances of landing in the shellcode.\n    *   Shellcode (generated using `msfvenom`) to establish a reverse TCP shell.\n*   **Exploit Steps:**\n    1.  Connect to the FTP server.\n    2.  Authenticate as an anonymous user.\n    3.  Send the crafted `RENAME` command containing the overflow payload.\n    4.  Close the connection.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific offset, EIP address, and a complete exploit script.",

The vulnerability involves a buffer overflow due to the lack of input size validation during a buffer copy operation in the RENAME command handler of the FTP server. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.8 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. This is a broader category that encompasses buffer overflows. CWE-120 is a more specific case. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which is a base-level CWE describing a buffer copy without checking the size of the input. This is a specific type of buffer overflow. CWE-119 is a parent class encompassing memory buffer boundary violations. The relationship between CWE-120 and CWE-119 is ChildOf. This means that CWE-120 is a specific type of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to a **buffer overflow** when copying data into a buffer without checking its size. This can then lead to arbitrary code execution.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Improper Input Validation** (not explicitly CWE'd but the underlying cause)\n  - **Weakness**: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n  - **Impact**: Arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** in the RENAME command handler of PCMan FTP Server. The server **does not properly validate the length of the input provided in the RENAME command**, allowing an attacker to send a string longer than the allocated buffer. This is a clear case of CWE-120, \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\". CWE-119, \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\" is a more general category, and while applicable, CWE-120 is more precise. The vulnerability description and the detailed exploit information provided in the CVE reference links content summary provides strong evidence for this assessment. The confidence score is 1.0 as the evidence is strong and the root cause is evident. The retriever results also supports this selection and lists CWE-120 as a strong candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to uploading dangerous file types.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to format string usage.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to authorization on URLs.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because it is related to injection, not buffer overflows.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not directly relevant as the **buffer overflow** is due to **not checking the input size** when copying, not necessarily an incorrect calculation of the buffer size, though it could be a contributing factor.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
