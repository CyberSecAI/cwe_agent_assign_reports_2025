Due to improper input validation, improper **deserialization**, and improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, IDOL2 is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and possibly remote code execution. There is an access violation and EIP overwrite after five logins.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45166:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The IDOL2 client application does not properly validate input data.\n*   **Improper Deserialization:** The application is vulnerable due to issues with how it deserializes data.\n*   **Improper Restriction of Operations within Memory Buffer:** The application doesn't properly manage operations within memory buffers, leading to potential buffer overflows.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the IDOL2 application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.\n*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution, though this is stated as a possibility rather than a certainty in this advisory.\n*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** The application fails to properly validate input, leading to other issues.\n*  **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer):** The application does not properly restrict operations within the bounds of a memory buffer.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a DoS attack, making the IDOL2 client unusable.\n*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** If exploited successfully, an attacker could gain control of the affected system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted data to the IDOL2 client via the network socket.\n*   The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates sending data to port 2012 of the client.\n    *   One payload demonstrates a crash (access violation and EIP overwrite) after repeated connections.\n    *   Another payload demonstrates triggering 100% CPU usage.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable IDOL2 client.\n*   **Ability to Send Malicious Data:** The attacker must be able to send specifically crafted data to the IDOL2 client's network port (2012).\n*   No authentication is mentioned, so it is implied that the vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is present in IDOL2 client versions 2.12 and earlier.\n*   The vendor (UCI Software GmbH) was notified on 2024-06-26, with public disclosure occurring on 2024-08-19 after a period of communication with the vendor.\n*   The advisory provides a Python proof-of-concept (PoC) script that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   The advisory includes links to the product website, the full SySS advisory, and the SySS Responsible Disclosure Policy.\n*   The issue is also tracked as CVE-2024-45167, which has an overlapping scope.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-45166 details a vulnerability in the IDOL2 client that stems from improper input validation, deserialization, and memory buffer handling. This can lead to DoS and potentially remote code execution, triggered by sending crafted data to the client's network port.",
