# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45166

# Vulnerability Description

    An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Due to improper input validation, improper **deserialization**, and improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, IDOL2 is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and possibly remote code execution. There is an access violation and EIP overwrite after five logins.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: ''improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer']'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 497.93)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 475.24)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....
