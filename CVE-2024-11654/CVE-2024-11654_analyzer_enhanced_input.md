## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/network/diag_traceroute6. The manipulation of the argument diag_traceroute6 leads to **command injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** EnGenius ENH1350EXT and ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT
- **version:** up to 20241118
- **component:** /admin/network/diag_traceroute6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `diag_traceroute6` interface of ENGENIUS routers. User-supplied input for the `diag_traceroute6` parameter is directly passed to the `diag_command` function without any filtering or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting shell metacharacters and commands into the `diag_traceroute6` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the absence of proper input validation or sanitization before passing user-controlled data to the command execution function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with system-level privileges on the router.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete control of the affected device, potentially allowing for data theft, malware installation, denial of service attacks, or the use of the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/` endpoint, specifically targeting the `diag_traceroute6` interface.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious commands within the `diag_traceroute6` URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin interface of the router, this is indicated by the presence of the `sysauth` cookie in the provided HTTP request.
- **Understanding of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and how to inject the malicious command, for this case, `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=[token]/admin/network/diag_traceroute6/` and also the `diag_traceroute6` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit using `curl` to make a request to an attacker-controlled domain (`yy03i77ylld04xa6y9gyz5mch3nubl59u.oastify.com`), which demonstrates the ability to execute commands on the router.
- The content also mentions that the researchers contacted ENGENIUS about the vulnerability but received no response.
- Affected devices include a wide range of ENGENIUS routers running different firmware versions, such as ENH1350EXT-3.5, ENS500-AC-v3.7.20, and ens620ext-all-v3.9.1.7.

This vulnerability poses a significant security risk to ENGENIUS router users.
