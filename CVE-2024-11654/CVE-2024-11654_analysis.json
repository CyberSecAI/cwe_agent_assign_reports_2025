  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/network/diag_traceroute6. The manipulation of the argument diag_traceroute6 leads to **command injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `diag_traceroute6` interface of ENGENIUS routers. User-supplied input for the `diag_traceroute6` parameter is directly passed to the `diag_command` function without any filtering or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting shell metacharacters and commands into the `diag_traceroute6` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the absence of proper input validation or sanitization before passing user-controlled data to the command execution function.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with system-level privileges on the router.\n- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete control of the affected device, potentially allowing for data theft, malware installation, denial of service attacks, or the use of the device as part of a botnet.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/` endpoint, specifically targeting the `diag_traceroute6` interface.\n- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious commands within the `diag_traceroute6` URL parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin interface of the router, this is indicated by the presence of the `sysauth` cookie in the provided HTTP request.\n- **Understanding of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and how to inject the malicious command, for this case, `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=[token]/admin/network/diag_traceroute6/` and also the `diag_traceroute6` parameter.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit using `curl` to make a request to an attacker-controlled domain (`yy03i77ylld04xa6y9gyz5mch3nubl59u.oastify.com`), which demonstrates the ability to execute commands on the router.\n- The content also mentions that the researchers contacted ENGENIUS about the vulnerability but received no response.\n- Affected devices include a wide range of ENGENIUS routers running different firmware versions, such as ENH1350EXT-3.5, ENS500-AC-v3.7.20, and ens620ext-all-v3.9.1.7.\n\nThis vulnerability poses a significant security risk to ENGENIUS router users.",

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `diag_traceroute6` interface of ENGENIUS routers. User-supplied input for the `diag_traceroute6` parameter is directly passed to the `diag_command` function without any filtering or validation, leading to **command injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) and CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command). While CWE-77 is more general, CWE-78 is more specific to OS commands, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description of **command injection** in an OS command context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization for the `diag_traceroute6` parameter.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Command Injection** (CWE-78).\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with system-level privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to **command injection** due to **improper neutralization of special elements** in the `diag_traceroute6` parameter. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states this root cause. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-78. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is the most specific and appropriate choice, being a child of the more general CWE-77. The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability involves the execution of OS commands, which is precisely what CWE-78 addresses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
