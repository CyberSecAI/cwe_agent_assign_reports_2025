This can lead to CWE-22, **path traversal**, allowing access to unauthorized directories. The **prototype pollution**, CWE-1321, is a separate but related vulnerability that can be exploited via the uploaded file. The path traversal and prototype pollution could be used to achieve code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe434\n    cwe1321 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe1321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unrestricted file upload** (CWE-434), which allows an attacker to upload a malicious file. This could be exploited using **path traversal** (CWE-22) to place the file in a sensitive location, or it could trigger **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321) via the contents of the uploaded file. The final impact is **code injection**, which is not represented by a specific CWE in this analysis because it's the resulting impact rather than the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the primary root cause is the **unrestricted file upload**, mapped to CWE-434. This enables the **path traversal** (CWE-22) and **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321) vulnerabilities. CWE-434 is the most direct representation of the initial flaw. The vulnerability description clearly states: \"**Prototype Pollution** in Kibana can lead to code injection via **unrestricted file upload** combined with **path traversal**.\" This supports the selection of CWE-434 as the primary CWE, with CWE-22 and CWE-1321 as secondary weaknesses that are enabled by the initial unrestricted upload. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the specific weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
