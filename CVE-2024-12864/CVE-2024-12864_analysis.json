  "description": "A **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability** was discovered in the file upload feature of netease-youdao/qanything version v2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users. This attack **does not require authentication**, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.",

CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 and represents the broader category of resource consumption issues. CWE-306 and CWE-1284 are related in that the missing authentication and improper input validation contribute to the vulnerability's exploitability and impact. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the more specific Base CWE-770 over the broader Class CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe306,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) and **improper input validation** (CWE-1284), which allows an attacker to send a large filename. This leads to the **allocation of resources without limits** (CWE-770), eventually resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\nCWE-306 -> CWE-1284 -> CWE-770 -> CWE-400 -> DoS\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that the root cause is the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename**, leading to a **Denial of Service**. The description explicitly states that the attack **does not require authentication**, which also contributes to the exploitability of the vulnerability.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating that it is a more specific type of resource consumption issue. CWE-306 and CWE-1284 can precede CWE-770, highlighting their role in enabling the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-770 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **allocation of resources without limits**, which is the **root cause** of the DoS vulnerability. CWE-400 is a broader category that encompasses resource consumption issues, but CWE-770 provides a more specific description of the weakness. CWE-306 and CWE-1284 are included as secondary CWEs because they contribute to the vulnerability's exploitability by allowing unauthenticated users to send large filenames without proper validation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and its contributing factors, based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 3700.94\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### 1.
