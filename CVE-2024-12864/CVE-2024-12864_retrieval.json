The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability** was discovered in the file upload feature of netease-youdao/qanything version v2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users. This attack **does not require authentication**, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper handling of form-data with a large filename'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
