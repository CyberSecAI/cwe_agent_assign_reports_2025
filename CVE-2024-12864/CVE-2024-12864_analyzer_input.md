# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12864

# Vulnerability Description

    A **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability** was discovered in the file upload feature of netease-youdao/qanything version v2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users. This attack **does not require authentication**, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.
