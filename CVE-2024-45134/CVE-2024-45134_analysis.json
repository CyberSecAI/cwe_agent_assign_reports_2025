However, the description primarily focuses on the exposure itself rather than the authorization mechanism, making it less directly relevant.\n\nI am overriding the \"Discouraged\" usage for CWE-200 because the description specifically mentions **Information Exposure** as the primary **weakness**, and a more specific CWE is not definitively supported by the available evidence.
