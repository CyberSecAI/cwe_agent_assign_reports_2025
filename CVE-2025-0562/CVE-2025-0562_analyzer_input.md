## Analysis of CVE-2025-0562 Content

The provided content **relates** to CVE-2025-0562. It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a SQL injection vulnerability in CodeZips Gym Management System v1.0. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and the lack of parameterized queries (prepared statements) when handling the `usrid` parameter in the `/dashboard/admin/health_status_entry.php` file. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (Error-based and Time-based blind)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Database compromise (read, modify, delete data)
*   Data leakage of sensitive information
*   System interruption/denial of service
*   Potential privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `usrid` parameter in a POST request to `/dashboard/admin/health_status_entry.php`.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   No specific privileges or authentication are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use Prepared Statements / Parameter Binding:** Separate SQL logic from user-supplied data.
*   **Enforce Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize the `usrid` parameter.
*   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit database user permissions.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct code reviews and penetration testing.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Gym Management System in PHP with Source Code, v1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/dashboard/admin/health_status_entry.php`
*   **Parameter:** `usrid`
