  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-3195. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause:**\nA SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/bbms.php' file of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'search\u2018 and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAttackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe 'search' parameter in '/bbms.php' is vulnerable. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nNo specific position or privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2. Input validation and filtering.\n3. Minimize database user permissions.\n4. Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples:**\nThe content provides several payload examples for different types of SQL injection attacks (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query).\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   **Affected Product:** Online Blood Bank Management System in PHP with Source Code, Version V1.0\n*   **Vulnerable File:** /bbms.php\n*   **Software Link:** <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-Php-with-Source-Code-1.zip>\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/>\n*   **Submitter:** PKEY\n*   Includes a command line example using sqlmap: `python \"E:\\Dawn Launcher\\PKEY\\Tools\\Web_Exploitation\\VulToolsKit\\DataBase\\sqlmap\\sqlmap-master\\sqlmap.py\" -r \"C:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\localhost_80_20250327212827.req\" --dbs --level 3 --risk 3 -p \"search\"`",

The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89. The abstraction level is Base, which is appropriate for the root cause. No other relationships significantly influenced the decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 (**SQL Injection**) due to improper neutralization of the search parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly states the presence of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability in the 'search' parameter of the '/bbms.php' file. The provided payloads and mitigation strategies further reinforce this assessment.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary weakness, with a score of 1.0. The mapping guidance for CWE-89 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which aligns with the goal of identifying the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.
