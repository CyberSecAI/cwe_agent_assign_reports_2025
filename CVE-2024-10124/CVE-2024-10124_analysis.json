  "description": "The Vayu Blocks Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation and activation due to a **missing capability check** on the tp_install() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated. This vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.1.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10124:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `tp_install()` function within the Vayu Blocks plugin. This function is intended for plugin installation and activation, but lacks proper verification of user capabilities before execution.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authorization:** The `tp_install()` function does not verify if the user has the necessary privileges (e.g., 'manage\\_options') to install or activate plugins.\n*   **Insecure REST API Endpoint:**  The `tp_install` function is registered as a REST API endpoint accessible via POST requests, without proper permission checks.\n* **Direct Object Reference:** The `tp_install()` function directly takes parameters from the request and uses them to install the plugin without proper sanitization or validation.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Due to the missing authorization, an unauthenticated user can call the vulnerable `tp_install()` function to install and activate arbitrary plugins.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation:** An attacker can install and activate any plugin they choose, effectively gaining full control of the WordPress site.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By installing a specially crafted malicious plugin or leveraging a vulnerability in another plugin, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the site and server.\n*  **Full Website Compromise:** By gaining remote code execution, the attacker can modify or delete files, inject malicious content, install backdoors, or perform other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct HTTP POST Requests:** An unauthenticated attacker can send a POST request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint (`ai/v1/vayu-site-builder`).\n*   **Exploitation of AJAX Actions:** The vulnerable code leverages AJAX actions which, when improperly secured, can allow unauthenticated users to trigger privileged actions on the site.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any user account or login credentials on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The Wordfence article states that the vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.1.1, but it was fully addressed in version 1.2.0.\n*   The provided code snippets from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` show the changes made in `app.php` to address the vulnerability by implementing proper capability checks.\n*   The changeset 3203532 shows that the function `register_routes` was introduced that registers the REST API route where the vulnerable function is called. Also, in that changeset, the `process_start` function was modified with nonce verification, but the vulnerability was not in this function, so this was not the fix for the CVE.\n* The code diffs highlight the movement of the rest API registration. Prior to the patch the rest API was registered as a part of the construct method, and was moved to the `register_routes` method, which includes `if(current_user_can('manage_options'))` check to control access.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-10124 represents a critical vulnerability due to the lack of proper authorization checks, which could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins and achieve remote code execution.",

The analysis revealed the vulnerability is due to a **missing capability check**, which falls directly under **missing authorization**. While CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] is a separate weakness, it can be triggered because of the missing authorization.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe434 -- CanFollow --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check on the `tp_install()` function (CWE-862). This allows unauthenticated attackers to install arbitrary plugins (CWE-434), which can then lead to remote code execution if a vulnerable plugin is installed and activated.\n  - CWE-862: Missing Authorization (**Root Cause**)\n  - CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n  - Remote Code Execution (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] as the primary weakness due to the **missing capability check** on the `tp_install()` function, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The Wordfence article and code diffs provided strong evidence supporting this. Additionally, the ability to install arbitrary plugins due to the **missing authorization** leads to the selection of CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type].
