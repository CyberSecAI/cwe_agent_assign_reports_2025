## Vulnerability Description
Buffer overflow vulnerability in OllyDbg, version 1.10, which could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code due to **lack of proper bounds checking**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper bounds checking**
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** OllyDbg
- **version:** 1.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in OllyDbg version 1.10 due to a lack of proper bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-119).
*  **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code. This indicates a high severity issue, as the attacker can gain control over the system.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where OllyDbg is running.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction is required (UI:R). The vulnerability has a scope change (S:C).

The provided information indicates that a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in OllyDbg version 1.10 that could allow for arbitrary code execution by a local attacker. The vulnerability is considered high severity with a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5.
