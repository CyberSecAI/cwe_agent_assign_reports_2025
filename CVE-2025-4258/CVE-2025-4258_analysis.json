Affected is the function Upload of the file \\\\youkefu-master\\\\src\\\\main\\\\java\\\\com\\\\ukefu\\\\webim\\\\web\\\\handler\\\\resource\\\\MediaController.java. The manipulation of the argument imgFile leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
