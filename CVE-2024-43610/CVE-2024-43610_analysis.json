Therefore, CWE-200 is selected, with the understanding that it's a high-level categorization.\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE. The guidance for CWE-200 states that it is **Discouraged** because it is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality which is a technical impact and not a root cause error.
