  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24857.",

The target must either:\n  - Visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.\n  - Open a specially crafted, malicious DXF file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Remote: The attacker can be remote as the vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file or webpage.\n- Ability to craft a malicious DXF file.\n- Ability to host the malicious file or webpage.",
