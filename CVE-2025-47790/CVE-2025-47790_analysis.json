The bug caused skipping the second factor confirmation after a successful login with the username and password when the server was configured with `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` set to `0`, once the session expired on the page to select the second factor and the page is reloaded. Nextcloud Server 29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 26.0.13.15, 27.1.11.15, 28.0.14.6, 29.0.15, 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 contain a patch. As a workaround, set the `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` in config.php to a value other than `0`, e.g. `900`. Beware that this is only a workaround for new sessions created after the configuration change. System administration can delete affected sessions.",

CWE-613 is a child of CWE-672 and represents a specific instance of session management failure. The vulnerability description indicates a **bug with session handling** that leads to bypassing the second factor authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource that Should Not Happen\"]\n    \n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe613 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **bug with session handling**. This leads to a situation where, under specific configurations (`remember_login_cookie_lifetime` set to `0`), the second factor confirmation is skipped after the session expires and the page is reloaded. This results in **improper authentication**, as the system **fails** to adequately verify the user's identity before granting access. The **impact** is the ability to bypass the second factor, compromising security.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies the **bug with session handling** as the primary cause, leading to **improper authentication**. The description mentions a specific scenario where the second factor is bypassed due to this **session handling issue**. The provided evidence points to a failure in managing session lifetimes correctly, causing the authentication process to be incomplete.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is influenced by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states \"The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-287\". Despite the discouraged usage of the Class-level CWE-287, it aligns with the overall authentication failure. The secondary CWE-613 captures the specific session expiration problem that contributes to the authentication bypass. The evidence for the root cause is \"bug with session handling\" and \"skipping the second factor confirmation\". The mitigations involve setting a non-zero value for `remember_login_cookie_lifetime`, which affects session duration.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence, which indicates an authentication bypass due to a **session handling bug**. While a more specific CWE related to session management might be ideal, the provided information primarily highlights the authentication failure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
