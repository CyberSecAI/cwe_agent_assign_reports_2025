  "description": "matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling **sharing message keys on invite** by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality. No known workarounds are available.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47824:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `matrix-react-sdk`'s practice of sharing historical message keys with newly invited users. This was done by calling `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` in the matrix-js-sdk.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- The core vulnerability lies in the insecure sharing of message keys upon invitation. A malicious homeserver could inject a malicious device controlled by the server and use this to potentially gain access to historical message keys.\n- The `matrix-react-sdk` was vulnerable because it was calling the vulnerable `sendSharedHistoryKeys` function.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A malicious homeserver could exploit this vulnerability to steal message keys for a room. This would allow the attacker to decrypt and read past messages in the room, violating the confidentiality of the communication.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector involves a malicious homeserver injecting a controlled device into the room. The homeserver then triggers an invite, causing the vulnerable `sendSharedHistoryKeys` to be called, which can potentially expose keys to the injected device.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to control a malicious homeserver.\n- The attacker's homeserver needs to be involved in a room where a user is being invited by a user employing the vulnerable `matrix-react-sdk` version.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the sharing of message keys on invite, specifically by removing the calls to `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys`.\n- This vulnerability is related to a vulnerability in `matrix-js-sdk` tracked as [CVE-2024-47080](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4jf8-g8wp-cx7c). While the underlying cause is in `matrix-js-sdk`, the specific use case of sharing keys on invite in `matrix-react-sdk` is considered a separate vulnerability.\n- The vulnerable code was removed in commit `6fc9d7641c51ca3db8225cf58b9d6e6fdd2d6556` which was part of the pull request #12618.\n- Versions of `matrix-react-sdk` prior to 3.102.0 were vulnerable.\n- The fix was implemented in matrix-react-sdk version 3.102.0.\n- The project has been archived and moved to [element-hq/matrix-react-sdk](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-react-sdk) after the fix, meaning that no releases in the new location were vulnerable.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by `dkasak`.",

The secondary CWE is CWE-923, which is at the Class level. CWE-322 is related to CWE-923 through a CANPRECEDE relationship, indicating that a key exchange without entity authentication can precede an improper restriction of the communication channel.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe322[\"CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Authentication Missing for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe322 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe923\n    cwe322 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe322 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n    class cwe306 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **sharing of message keys on invite**, leading to a **key exchange without entity authentication (CWE-322)**. This can then lead to an **improper restriction of the communication channel (CWE-923)**, as the malicious homeserver can inject a device and gain access to historical message keys, ultimately resulting in the ability to **steal message keys for a room**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key phrase **\"sharing message keys on invite\"** and the description of how a malicious homeserver could inject a device to steal message keys pointed towards a potential issue with key exchange and authentication.\n\nCWE-322, Key Exchange without Entity Authentication, was chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems from the insecure sharing of message keys upon invitation, which effectively bypasses proper authentication mechanisms. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions the `matrix-react-sdk`'s practice of sharing historical message keys with newly invited users, which directly relates to the concept of key exchange without proper verification.\n\nCWE-923, Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints, was considered as a secondary CWE because the malicious homeserver is injecting a controlled device into the communication channel.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several other CWEs, including CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) and CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). However, these were deemed less relevant as the primary issue is the insecure key exchange rather than a complete bypass of authentication or improper input handling.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-322 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to root causes, and it accurately represents the weakness of insecure key exchange.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
