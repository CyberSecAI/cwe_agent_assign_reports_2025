# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-29907

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability occurs when the product uses a regular expression with an inefficient complexity, leading to excessive CPU cycles. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The uncontrolled resource consumption leading to a denial of service. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1333, which is a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) can be a consequence of CWE-1333, where inefficient regex leads to high CPU usage. The selection of CWE-1333 is more specific and at the Base level of abstraction, aligning with the vulnerability's root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **user control of the first argument of the addImage method**, which leads to the use of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333). The inefficient regex causes high CPU utilization, resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and ultimately a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **user control** aspect and its impact. The CVE description and summary highlight that **user control of the first argument of the addImage method** allows for a harmful data-url to be passed, leading to high CPU utilization and denial of service. The retriever results pointed to CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as a strong candidate, which aligns with the root cause of high CPU utilization.

The selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence that a harmful data-url triggers an inefficient regular expression, consuming excessive CPU cycles. CWE-400 is a secondary effect of this inefficiency. The relationships between these CWEs, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-407 and the potential chain leading to CWE-400, support this classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
