An attacker crafts a malicious link and tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting it.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to visit it. The administrator needs to be logged into the WordPress dashboard for the exploit to succeed.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not have CSRF check', 'keyphrase': 'does not have CSRF check', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:reset form fields', 'keyphrase': 'reset form fields', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:CSRF attack', 'keyphrase': 'CSRF attack', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:attackers', 'keyphrase': 'attackers', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 2.9.8', 'keyphrase': 'through 2.9.8', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(448.35615213845233)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '862', 'name': 'Missing Authorization', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not have CSRF check', 'keyphrase': 'does not have CSRF check', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:reset form fields', 'keyphrase': 'reset form fields', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:CSRF attack', 'keyphrase': 'CSRF attack', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:attackers', 'keyphrase': 'attackers', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 2.9.8', 'keyphrase': 'through 2.9.8', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(341.79974126633545)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
