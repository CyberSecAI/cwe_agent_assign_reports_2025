    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap-based buffer over-read'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 281.78)

The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 275.35)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 3. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 245.24)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....

### 4. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 239.71)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 218.42)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 226.20)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

## PRODUCT: 'radareorg radare2'

Relevant CWEs for this PRODUCT:

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 275.35)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 3. CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value (Score: 75.97)

The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer....

### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 74.47)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 5. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 57.35)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....
