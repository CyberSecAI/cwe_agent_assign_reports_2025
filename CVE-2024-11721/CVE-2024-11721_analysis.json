  "description": "The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.24.5. This is due to **insufficient controls on the user role select field** when utilizing the Role field in a form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new administrative user accounts, even when the administrative user role has not been provided as an option to the user, granted that unauthenticated users have been provided access to the form.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11721\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls on the user role selection field within the \"Frontend Admin by DynamiApps\" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate the selected user role when a form is submitted, allowing unauthorized users to assign roles that were not intended to be available for selection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is the failure to enforce proper authorization on the user role selection.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not adequately validate the selected role against the allowed options.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** If a form is accessible to unauthenticated users, it allows them to create administrative accounts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** An unauthenticated attacker can create a new administrative user account by exploiting this vulnerability.\n- **Complete Control of the WordPress Site:** With a new administrator account, the attacker gains full control over the affected website.\n- **Potential Data Breach/Manipulation:** Attackers can use their gained access to steal, modify, or delete site data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network through web requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.\n- **Form Manipulation:** Attackers would manipulate the 'Role' field in a form provided by the plugin.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access to the Vulnerable Form:** The attacker needs to access a form that utilizes the vulnerable user role selection feature.\n- **Basic Knowledge of Web Requests:** They would need to understand how to send web requests and manipulate form data.\n- **No Prior Authentication:** No prior user credentials are required to perform this exploit.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class-role.php` file within the plugin.\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.25.1 of the plugin.\n*   The fix involved adding validation to ensure that the selected role is among the options the form is designed to provide, and invalid role selections lead to user deletion, preventing privilege escalation",

The plugin **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The plugin **incorrectly assigns a privilege** (administrative user role) to an unauthenticated actor. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862, Missing Authorization, which reflects the core issue of the plugin not checking authorization when creating new user accounts. CWE-266, Incorrect Privilege Assignment, is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability also involves assigning incorrect privileges to unauthorized users. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-266 is at the base level. The relationship between them is that **missing authorization** can lead to **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), leading to the **incorrect assignment of administrative privileges** (CWE-266) to unauthenticated users. This ultimately results in privilege escalation and complete control of the WordPress site.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as the primary CWE due to the **lack of authorization checks on the user role select field**. The retriever results, vulnerability description, and CVE reference links all point to the core issue of **missing authorization** leading to privilege escalation. The relationship analysis shows how missing authorization can lead to incorrect privilege assignment. The mapping guidance emphasizes the importance of identifying the root cause, which in this case is the **missing authorization check**. The evidence from the vulnerability description, particularly the phrases \"**insufficient controls on the user role select field**\" and \"**does not properly validate the selected user role**,\" supports the classification of CWE-862 as the primary CWE. Additionally, CWE-266, Incorrect Privilege Assignment, is considered as a secondary CWE due to the **incorrect assignment of admin privileges**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 being a class-level CWE and CWE-266 being a base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**\nThe product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description, where the plugin fails to check if the user is authorized to create administrative accounts.\n*   **Security Implications:** Unauthorized users can perform actions they should not be able to, such as creating administrative accounts.\n*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, complete control of the WordPress site.\n\n**CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment**\nA product **incorrectly assigns a privilege** to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. This is relevant because the unauthenticated user is being assigned the administrative privilege incorrectly.\n*   **Security Implications:** Unauthorized users gain higher levels of access, leading to privilege escalation.\n*   **Impact:** Complete control of the WordPress site, potential data breach/manipulation.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Considered but not used because the vulnerability is that there **is no** authorization check, not that the authorization check is performed incorrectly.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Authentication is not the primary issue; the problem is the lack of authorization after a user interacts with the form, so this CWE is not the best fit.\n*   CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management): This is too high level and discouraged. The root cause is more specifically related to missing authorization, making CWE-862 a better fit.",
