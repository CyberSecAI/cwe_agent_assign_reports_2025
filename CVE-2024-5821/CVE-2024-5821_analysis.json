  "description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by confusing the agent with incorrect file names. When a user requests the content of a file with a misspelled name, the agent attempts to correct the command and inadvertently reveals the content of the intended file, such as /etc/passwd.

The secondary CWE, CWE-550, is a variant that specifically deals with the exposure of sensitive information via server-generated error messages. While CWE-550 is more specific, the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that an error message is the vector. Therefore, CWE-200 is used as the primary, with CWE-550 as additional context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe550[\"CWE-550: Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe550 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe550 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  An attacker provides an incorrect file name.\n2.  The agent attempts to correct the command.\n3.  The agent inadvertently reveals the content of the intended file.\n4.  Sensitive information is exposed to the attacker.\n\nHere, CWE-200 represents the final impact, while the agent's behavior leading to the information exposure isn't covered by the description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered several CWEs, including CWE-22 (Path Traversal), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication), and CWE-611 (XXE). However, the vulnerability description's key point is the exposure of sensitive information due to the agent's behavior, rather than path manipulation, missing authentication, or XML processing issues.\n\nThe final decision leans towards CWE-200 because the vulnerability's core impact is the unauthorized exposure of sensitive data. The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential server compromise.\" The inclusion of CWE-550 provides more context, as it specifies that the exposure might occur through server-generated error messages, but the description lacks explicit confirmation of this mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
