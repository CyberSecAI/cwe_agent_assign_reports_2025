  "description": "A vulnerability was found in BlackVue App 3.65 on Android and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component API Endpoint Handler. The manipulation of the argument BCS_TOKEN/SECRET_KEY leads to **unprotected storage of credentials**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE that could be considered a parent of CWE-312, but CWE-312 is more specific. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) represents the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe200 -->|IMPACTOF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unprotected storage of credentials** (CWE-312), which directly leads to the potential exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **unprotected storage of credentials**, which maps directly to CWE-312. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this weakness. Other CWEs like CWE-522 and CWE-200 are related, but they represent a broader class and the impact, respectively. The retriever results also included several other CWEs, such as those related to SQL injection and cross-site scripting, but these are not relevant given the vulnerability description and key phrases provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the description does not discuss discrepancies in behavior that leak information.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
