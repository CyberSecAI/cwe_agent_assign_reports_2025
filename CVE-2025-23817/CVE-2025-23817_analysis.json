This can lead to an attacker forcing a user to perform actions without their consent. The secondary weakness is CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], a base weakness, arises from the application's failure to neutralize user-controllable input before embedding it in web pages, leading to **XSS** vulnerabilities. CWE-79 is a prerequisite for Stored **XSS**, which is mentioned in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** of CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], where the application fails to properly validate the origin of requests. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious input. Subsequently, the **WEAKNESS** of CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] leads to stored **XSS**, because the injected input is not properly neutralized before being rendered in a web page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies two primary weaknesses: CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, which maps directly to CWE-352. The presence of stored **XSS** indicates that user input is not being properly neutralized, which maps to CWE-79. Both of these weaknesses are supported by the vulnerability description. The retriever results also indicate the high relevance of these CWEs to the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-352 and CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the **ROOTCAUSE** and the resulting **WEAKNESS** that leads to the **XSS** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
