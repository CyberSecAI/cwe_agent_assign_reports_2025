# Analysis for CVE-2024-42090

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base |  Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-833 (Deadlock), which is a base-level CWE, making it suitable for direct mapping. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-833. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation caused by improper locking, so CWE-833 is the more specific and appropriate choice. There are no other significant hierarchical or chain relationships that influence the selection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of the following steps:
1.  `pinctrl_maps_mutex` is acquired.
2.  `add_setting()` is called.
3.  `add_setting()` returns `-EPROBE_DEFER`.
4.  `create_pinctrl()` calls `pinctrl_free()`.
5.  `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire `pinctrl_maps_mutex`, leading to a **deadlock**.

The root cause is the **improper locking** mechanism, but the direct result and main weakness is the **deadlock** itself.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states that a **deadlock** occurs because `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held by `create_pinctrl()`.

> **Vulnerability Description**: In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl() calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire pinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to a potential **deadlock**.

The retriever results also point to CWE-833 (Deadlock) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as potential candidates. Given that the base-level CWE-833 (Deadlock) accurately describes the vulnerability, it is chosen as the primary CWE. The parent class CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is considered as a secondary candidate but is less specific.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
