  "query": "A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsyncs handling of symbolic links. Rsyncs default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
