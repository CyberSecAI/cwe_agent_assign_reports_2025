# Vulnerability Description

    The Popup MailChimp, GetResponse and ActiveCampaign Intergrations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the id parameter of the upc_delete_db_record AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
