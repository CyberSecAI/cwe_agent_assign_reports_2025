# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37978
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block integrity Do not call set_page_dirty_lock() Placing multiple protection information buffers inside the same page can lead to oopses because set_page_dirty_lock() cant be called from interrupt context. Since a protection information buffer is not backed by a file there is no point in setting its page dirty, there is nothing to synchronize. Drop the call to set_page_dirty_lock() and remove the last argument to bio_integrity_unpin_bvec().
